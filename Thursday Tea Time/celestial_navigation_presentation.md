# Celestial Navigation with a Sextant
## 20-Minute Presentation Outline

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Duration:** 30 seconds

### Celestial Navigation with a Sextant
*Finding Your Position Using the Stars*

---

## Slide 2: Why Celestial Navigation?
**Duration:** 1 minute

### Key Points:
- GPS-independent navigation - works when electronics fail
- Required for ocean passages and maritime certification
- Practiced for thousands of years - proven reliability
- Personal seamanship skill and self-reliance
- Still used by military as backup navigation

### Speaker Notes:
"Before GPS, every ship crossing an ocean relied on celestial navigation. Today, it remains a critical backup skill and is still required for many offshore certifications."

---

## Slide 3: What is a Sextant?
**Duration:** 1.5 minutes

### Definition:
A precision optical instrument that measures the angle between two objects - typically a celestial body and the horizon.

### Key Components:
| Part | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Frame/Arc** | Graduated scale (typically 0-120°) |
| **Index Mirror** | Reflects image of celestial body |
| **Horizon Mirror** | Split mirror - see horizon and body simultaneously |
| **Telescope** | Magnifies the view |
| **Drum Micrometer** | Fine angle adjustment (to 0.1 arcminute) |
| **Index Arm** | Moves the index mirror |
| **Shades** | Filters for sun observations |

### Speaker Notes:
"The sextant gets its name from the 60-degree arc (one-sixth of a circle) on early instruments. Modern sextants typically have a 120-degree arc."

### Suggested Image:

## Slide 4: The Principle - Double Reflection
**Duration:** 2 minutes

### How It Works:
1. Light from a celestial body hits the **index mirror**
2. Reflects to the **horizon mirror**
3. Observer sees the body superimposed on the horizon
4. The angle measured = **2× the mirror rotation**

### The Key Insight:
> "The altitude of a celestial body tells you your distance from the point on Earth directly beneath that body."

### Speaker Notes:
"When you measure the sun at 45° altitude, you know you're on a circle approximately 2,700 nautical miles from the sun's geographic position. This is the foundation of celestial navigation."

---

## Slide 5: Celestial Bodies Used
**Duration:** 1.5 minutes

### Primary Bodies:
| Body | When Used | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Sun** | Daytime | Most common, noon sight gives latitude directly |
| **Moon** | Day or night | Requires additional corrections |
| **Venus** | Twilight | Brightest planet, often visible in daylight |
| **57 Navigational Stars** | Night (twilight) | Selected for brightness and distribution |

### Key Navigational Stars (Southern Hemisphere Focus):
1. **Acrux** - Brightest star in Southern Cross, points to pole
2. **Canopus** - Second brightest star in sky, circumpolar in south
3. **Sirius** - Brightest star in sky, visible from both hemispheres
4. **Alpha Centauri** - Pointer star to Southern Cross
5. **Achernar** - End of river Eridanus, helps find south pole
6. **Fomalhaut** - "Lonely star" of southern autumn
7. **Rigel** - Orion's foot, visible worldwide

### Speaker Notes:
"Twilight is the golden hour for celestial navigation - you can see both the horizon and the stars clearly."

---

## Slide 6: The Navigational Triangle (PZX Triangle)
**Duration:** 2 minutes

### The Foundation of Celestial Navigation

The **PZX Triangle** (or Astronomical Triangle) is a spherical triangle on the celestial sphere connecting your position to a celestial body.

### The Three Vertices:

| Point | Name | Definition |
|-------|------|------------|
| **P** | Elevated Pole | South Celestial Pole (for Southern Hemisphere observers) |
| **Z** | Zenith | Point directly above the observer |
| **X** | Celestial Body | Sun, moon, star, or planet being observed |

*Note: The "elevated pole" is whichever celestial pole is above your horizon - South Celestial Pole for Southern Hemisphere, North Celestial Pole for Northern Hemisphere.*

### The Three Sides:

| Side | Name | What It Represents |
|------|------|-------------------|
| **PZ** | Co-Latitude | 90° minus your latitude |
| **PX** | Polar Distance | 90° minus the body's declination |
| **ZX** | Co-Altitude | 90° minus the observed altitude (zenith distance) |

### The Three Angles:

| Angle | Name | Significance |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **At P** | Local Hour Angle (LHA) | How far the body is from your meridian |
| **At Z** | Azimuth | Compass direction to the body |
| **At X** | Parallactic Angle | (Less commonly used) |

### How It Works in Practice:

1. **From the Nautical Almanac:** Declination (PX) and GHA → LHA (angle at P)
2. **From your assumed position:** Your latitude (PZ side)
3. **From the sextant:** Altitude → gives you ZX side
4. **The math solves for:** Calculated altitude (Hc) and Azimuth (Zn)
5. **Compare Hc to observed altitude (Ho):** Difference = Intercept (nautical miles)

### Speaker Notes:
"Think of it as a triangle drawn on a globe connecting three points: the pole, the point directly above you, and the star you're looking at. If we know any three elements, we can solve for the others."

## Slide 7: Essential Tools
**Duration:** 1 minute

### The Navigator's Kit:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Sextant** | Measure altitude of celestial body |
| **Accurate Timepiece** | Time of observation (to the second) |
| **Nautical Almanac** | Daily positions of celestial bodies |
| **Sight Reduction Tables** | Pre-computed solutions (HO-249 or HO-229) |
| **Plotting Sheet** | Chart for drawing position lines |
| **Dividers & Parallel Rules** | Plotting tools |

### Why Time Matters:
- Earth rotates 15° per hour (360° ÷ 24 hours)
- 1 minute of time error = 15 nautical miles of position error
- 4 seconds of time error = 1 nautical mile

### Speaker Notes:
"John Harrison's marine chronometer, invented in 1761, finally solved the longitude problem by keeping accurate time at sea."

---

## Slide 8: Taking a Sight - Setup
**Duration:** 1.5 minutes

### Preparation:
1. **Check index error** - sextant's built-in calibration error
2. **Set approximate altitude** on the arc
3. **Select appropriate shades** (for sun observations)
4. **Note the time** - have a watch ready or an assistant

### Holding the Sextant:
- Hold vertically with right hand on the frame
- Left hand adjusts the drum micrometer
- Brace yourself against the ship's motion
- Keep both eyes open

### The "Rocking" Technique:
- Rotate the sextant slightly left and right
- The body should swing in an arc
- The lowest point of the arc = true altitude
- This ensures the sextant is truly vertical

### Speaker Notes:
"Practice on land first. Find a building of known height, measure its angle, and calculate the distance to verify your technique."

---

## Slide 9: Taking a Sight - Measurement
**Duration:** 1.5 minutes

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Acquire the body** through the telescope
2. **Bring it down** to the horizon using the index arm
3. **Rock the sextant** to find the lowest point
4. **Touch the horizon** - body should just kiss the horizon line
5. **Call "MARK!"** at the exact moment
6. **Record the time** (to the second)
7. **Read the angle** from the arc and drum

### What You Record:
```
Date: 15 Jan 2024
Body: Sun (Lower Limb)
Time (UTC): 02:32:47
Sextant Altitude (Hs): 58° 15.3'
Index Error: +2.0' (on the arc)
Height of Eye: 3 meters
Position: Southern Indian Ocean
```

### Speaker Notes:
"Lower limb means you brought the bottom edge of the sun to the horizon. This is standard practice because it's easier to judge than the center."

---

## Slide 10: Corrections
**Duration:** 2 minutes

### From Sextant Altitude (Hs) to Observed Altitude (Ho):

| Correction | Reason | Typical Value |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| **Index Error** | Sextant calibration | ±0-5' |
| **Dip** | Height of eye above water | -3' per 3m height |
| **Refraction** | Atmosphere bends light | -1' to -34' |
| **Semi-diameter** | Sun/Moon radius | ±16' (sun) |
| **Parallax** | Moon only | Up to 61' |

### The Correction Formula:
```
Ho = Hs ± Index Error - Dip - Refraction ± Semi-diameter
```

### Example:
```
Sextant Altitude (Hs):     42° 15.3'
Index Error (+2.0' on):    -  2.0'
Dip (3m height):           -  3.0'
Refraction:                -  1.1'
Semi-diameter (lower limb):+ 16.0'
                           ─────────
Observed Altitude (Ho):    42° 25.2'
```

### Speaker Notes:
"The Nautical Almanac includes correction tables that combine these into a single 'altitude correction' for simplicity."

---

## Slide 11: The Noon Sight
**Duration:** 2 minutes

### The Simplest Celestial Observation

When the sun crosses your meridian (local apparent noon):
- The sun is at its highest point
- The PZX triangle collapses to a straight line
- **Latitude can be calculated directly** - no sight reduction tables needed!

### The Formula:
```
Latitude = 90° - Altitude + Declination (same name)
Latitude = 90° - Altitude - Declination (contrary name)
```
*"Same name" = both North or both South*

### Procedure:
1. Start observing ~15 minutes before estimated noon
2. Track the sun as it rises
3. Note when it stops rising and begins to fall
4. Record the **maximum altitude**
5. Note the **exact time** (this gives you longitude approximation)

### Example (Southern Hemisphere):
```
Maximum Altitude (Ho): 72° 15'
Sun's Declination:     S 15° 30' (from Almanac - summer in south)
Observer in Southern Hemisphere (same name - both South)

Latitude = 90° - 72° 15' + 15° 30'
Latitude = 17° 45' + 15° 30'
Latitude = 33° 15' S
```

*Note: "Same name" means latitude and declination are both South (or both North). "Contrary name" means they are opposite.*

### Speaker Notes:
"The noon sight has been used for centuries. It's reliable, straightforward, and gives you a confirmed latitude with minimal calculation."

---

## Slide 12: Plotting a Line of Position (LOP)
**Duration:** 2 minutes

### The Intercept Method (Marcq St. Hilaire Method)

#### Step 1: Start with an Assumed Position (AP)
- Use your dead reckoning position
- Round latitude to whole degrees for easier table lookup

#### Step 2: Calculate What You *Should* See
- Use sight reduction tables (HO-249 or HO-229)
- Enter with: Assumed Latitude, Declination, Local Hour Angle
- Get: Calculated Altitude (Hc) and Azimuth (Zn)

#### Step 3: Compare to What You *Actually* Saw
```
Intercept = Ho - Hc
```
- **Ho > Hc:** You're closer to the body → "Toward"
- **Ho < Hc:** You're farther from the body → "Away"

#### Step 4: Plot the Line
1. From your AP, draw a line toward the body (azimuth direction)
2. Mark the intercept distance (1' = 1 nautical mile)
3. Draw a perpendicular line through that point
4. **This is your Line of Position**

### The Rule:
> **"Computed Greater Away"** (CGA) - if Hc > Ho, plot away from the body

### Speaker Notes:
"You're not ON this line exactly - you're somewhere along it. You need at least two lines to get a fix."

---

## Slide 13: The Fix
**Duration:** 1 minute

### Where Two or More Lines Cross

| Fix Type | Method | Best Practice |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Running Fix** | Two sun sights, hours apart | Advance first LOP for distance traveled |
| **Star Fix** | 3+ stars at twilight | Ideal: 3 stars, 120° apart |
| **Sun-Moon Fix** | Daytime | When moon is visible |

### The Cocked Hat:
- Three LOPs rarely intersect at a single point
- They form a small triangle called the "cocked hat"
- Your position is assumed to be inside this triangle
- Smaller triangle = more accurate fix

### Accuracy:
- Good sextant work: ±1-2 nautical miles
- Excellent conditions: ±0.5 nautical miles
- Compare to GPS: ±10 meters

### Speaker Notes:
"A 2-mile accuracy might seem rough compared to GPS, but it's remarkable given you're measuring angles to stars millions of miles away with a handheld instrument."

---

## Slide 14: Finding South - The Southern Cross
**Duration:** 1.5 minutes

### Navigation Without Polaris

Unlike the Northern Hemisphere, there's no bright star at the South Celestial Pole. Instead, navigators use the **Southern Cross (Crux)** constellation.

### Method 1: The 4.5× Extension (Simplest)
1. Identify the Southern Cross (Gacrux at top, Acrux at bottom)
2. Draw an imaginary line from Gacrux through Acrux
3. Extend this line **4.5 times** the length of the Cross
4. This point is the South Celestial Pole
5. Drop straight down to the horizon = **Due South**

### Method 2: Using the Pointer Stars (More Accurate)
1. Draw Line 1 through the long axis of the Cross
2. Find Alpha and Beta Centauri (the "Pointers")
3. Draw Line 2 connecting the Pointers
4. Find the midpoint of Line 2
5. Draw Line 3 perpendicular from this midpoint
6. Where Lines 1 and 3 intersect = South Celestial Pole

### Avoiding the False Cross:
- The False Cross (in Carina/Vela) looks similar but is larger and dimmer
- It does NOT point to the South Celestial Pole
- The true Southern Cross has a 5th star (Epsilon Crucis) inside it

- [Constellation Guide](https://www.constellation-guide.com/the-southern-cross/)

### Speaker Notes:
"Polynesian navigators crossed thousands of miles of Pacific Ocean using the Southern Cross and other stars centuries before Europeans had reliable celestial navigation."

---

## Slide 15: Practical Demonstration
**Duration:** 1.5 minutes

### Walk-Through Example: Noon Sight

**Scenario:** You're sailing in the Southern Indian Ocean, DR position approximately 35°S, 80°E (between Australia and South Africa)

**Observation:**
- Date: March 21 (Equinox - sun on celestial equator)
- Maximum sun altitude: 55° 00' (sun bears North at noon)
- Sun's declination: 0° (equinox)

**Calculation:**
```
Latitude = 90° - Ho ± Declination
Latitude = 90° - 55° 00' ± 0°
Latitude = 35° 00' S
```

**Result:** Your latitude is 35° South - confirmed!

*Note: In the Southern Hemisphere at noon, the sun bears North (not South as in the Northern Hemisphere).*

### Speaker Notes:
"The equinox is the easiest day to demonstrate because the sun's declination is zero. Notice that from the Southern Hemisphere, we face North to observe the noon sun."

# Appendix A: Calculating Longitude - Complete Worked Example

## The Longitude Problem

Unlike latitude (which can be found directly from a noon sight), **longitude requires accurate time**. This was the great challenge of navigation for centuries - solved only when John Harrison invented the marine chronometer in 1761.

### The Key Relationship:

> **Longitude = GHA of body - LHA of body**
>
> Or equivalently:
> **LHA = GHA ± Longitude** (+ for West, - for East)

Where:
- **GHA** (Greenwich Hour Angle) = angle of body west of Greenwich meridian (from Almanac)
- **LHA** (Local Hour Angle) = angle of body west of observer's meridian
- **Longitude** = the difference between these two

---

## Understanding Hour Angles

### Greenwich Hour Angle (GHA)
- Measured **westward** from Greenwich (0° to 360°)
- Found in the Nautical Almanac for the exact time of observation
- Changes continuously as Earth rotates (15° per hour for stars, ~15° for sun)

### Local Hour Angle (LHA)
- Measured **westward** from the observer's meridian (0° to 360°)
- This is what we need for sight reduction tables
- Calculated from: **LHA = GHA - West Longitude** or **LHA = GHA + East Longitude**

### The Critical Insight:
If you know the GHA (from the Almanac + accurate time) and can determine the LHA (from the sight reduction), the difference gives you longitude!

---

## Complete Worked Example: Sun Sight for Longitude

### Scenario

You're sailing in the Southern Indian Ocean, en route from Fremantle, Australia to Mauritius.
- **Date:** January 15, 2024 (summer in Southern Hemisphere)
- **DR Position:** 32° 00' S, 85° 00' E (your best estimate)
- **Time of observation (UTC):** 06:42:35 (early afternoon local time)
- **Body observed:** Sun (lower limb)
- **Sextant altitude (Hs):** 68° 23.5' (sun high in summer)
- **Index error:** 1.5' off the arc (add)
- **Height of eye:** 3 meters

### Step 1: Apply Corrections to Get Observed Altitude (Ho)

```
Sextant Altitude (Hs):          68° 23.5'
Index Correction (+1.5' off):   +    1.5'
                                ──────────
Apparent Altitude:              68° 25.0'

Dip (3m height of eye):         -    3.0'
                                ──────────
                                68° 22.0'

Altitude Correction (sun, LL):  +   15.6'   (from Nautical Almanac tables)
                                ──────────
Observed Altitude (Ho):         68° 37.6'
```

### Step 2: Extract Data from the Nautical Almanac

**For January 15, 2024 at 06:00 UTC:**

| Data | Value | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| GHA Sun (06:00) | 268° 52.3' | Daily pages |
| Declination (06:00) | S 21° 08.4' | Daily pages (sun in south = summer) |
| d correction | +0.4' | Daily pages |
| GHA increment (42m 35s) | 10° 38.8' | Increments table |

**Calculate GHA at observation time:**
```
GHA (06:00 UTC):        268° 52.3'
Increment (42m 35s):    + 10° 38.8'
                        ───────────
GHA Sun (06:42:35):     279° 31.1'
```

**Calculate Declination at observation time:**
```
Declination (06:00):    S 21° 08.4'
d correction (42.6m):   +     0.3'    (d = +0.4' × 42.6/60)
                        ───────────
Declination:            S 21° 08.7'
```

*Note: In January, the sun's declination is South (summer in Southern Hemisphere), which is "same name" as our Southern Hemisphere position.*

### Step 3: Set Up for Sight Reduction

**Choose an Assumed Position (AP):**
- Assumed Latitude: **32° S** (round to whole degree)
- Assumed Longitude: **84° 31.1' E** (chosen so LHA comes out to whole degree)

**Calculate Local Hour Angle (LHA):**
```
GHA:                    279° 31.1'
Assumed Longitude (E):  + 84° 31.1'   (ADD for East longitude)
                        ───────────
                        364° 02.2'

Since result > 360°, subtract 360°:
LHA:                      4° 00.0'
```

*Note: For Eastern longitudes, ADD the longitude to GHA. For Western longitudes, SUBTRACT.*

### Step 4: Enter Sight Reduction Tables (HO-249 Vol. 2)

**Entering arguments:**
- Assumed Latitude: 32° S
- Declination: 21° (same name as latitude - both South)
- LHA: 4°

**From HO-249 tables:**
```
Tabulated Hc:           68° 42'
d value:                +18
Z value:                173°
```

**Interpolate for actual declination (21° 08.7'):**
```
Declination correction: 8.7' × 18/60 = +2.6' ≈ +3'

Calculated Altitude (Hc): 68° 42' + 3' = 68° 45'
```

**Convert Z to Azimuth (Zn):**
- Rule for Southern Hemisphere, LHA < 180°: Zn = 180° - Z
- Zn = 180° - 173° = **007°** (nearly due North)

*Note: In January from 32°S, the afternoon sun is high and bears slightly west of north.*

### Step 5: Calculate the Intercept

```
Observed Altitude (Ho):     68° 37.6'
Calculated Altitude (Hc):   68° 45.0'
                            ──────────
Intercept (Ho - Hc):        -7.4' = 7.4 nautical miles AWAY
```

**Interpretation:** Ho < Hc, so we're **7.4 nm farther from the sun** than the assumed position.

### Step 6: Plot the Line of Position

1. **Plot the Assumed Position (AP):** 32° 00' S, 84° 31.1' E
2. **Draw azimuth line:** From AP toward 007° (direction to sun - nearly due North)
3. **Mark intercept:** 7.4 nm AWAY from sun (opposite direction, toward 187°)
4. **Draw LOP:** Perpendicular to azimuth through the intercept point

### Step 7: Determine Longitude

The Line of Position runs roughly E-W (perpendicular to azimuth 007°).

**From plotting or calculation:**

Your position lies somewhere along this line. Combined with your latitude from a noon sight or other observation:

```
If Latitude (from noon sight):  32° 15' S
Reading from the LOP:           Longitude ≈ 84° 45' E
```

*Note: When the sun is nearly due north (as it is from the Southern Hemisphere in summer), the LOP runs nearly east-west, which is excellent for determining longitude.*

---

## The Direct Time-Sight Method (Alternative)

For a quicker longitude estimate when the sun is near the prime vertical (bearing ~090° or ~270°):

### Formula:
```
cos(LHA) = [sin(Ho) - sin(Lat) × sin(Dec)] / [cos(Lat) × cos(Dec)]
```

Then:
```
Longitude = GHA - LHA  (if LHA < 180°, afternoon)
Longitude = GHA - (360° - LHA)  (if LHA > 180°, morning)
```

### Using Our Example Values:
```
Ho = 68° 37.6' = 68.63°
Lat = 32° 15' S = -32.25° (negative for calculation)
Dec = 21° 08.7' S = -21.145° (negative for calculation)

cos(LHA) = [sin(68.63°) - sin(-32.25°) × sin(-21.145°)] / [cos(-32.25°) × cos(-21.145°)]
cos(LHA) = [0.9304 - (-0.5334) × (-0.3607)] / [0.8462 × 0.9327]
cos(LHA) = [0.9304 - 0.1924] / [0.7893]
cos(LHA) = 0.7380 / 0.7893
cos(LHA) = 0.9350

LHA = arccos(0.9350) = 20.8°
```

Since observation was in the afternoon (sun west of meridian in Southern Hemisphere), LHA is small and positive.

For eastern longitudes:
```
Longitude (East) = LHA - GHA + 360° (if result < 0)
Longitude = 4° - 279.5° + 360°
Longitude = 84.5° E ✓
```

**Result: Longitude ≈ 84° 30' E** (close to our assumed position in the Southern Indian Ocean!)

## Summary: The Longitude Calculation Process (Southern Hemisphere Example)

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Record exact UTC time | 06:42:35 |
| 2 | Correct sextant altitude | Ho = 68° 37.6' |
| 3 | Get GHA from Almanac | GHA = 279° 31.1' |
| 4 | Calculate LHA (add for East longitude) | LHA = 4° |
| 5 | Use sight reduction for Hc and Zn | Hc = 68° 45', Zn = 007° |
| 6 | Calculate intercept | 7.4 nm Away |
| 7 | Plot LOP | Line through intercept, perpendicular to Zn |
| 8 | Combine with latitude LOP | **Fix gives longitude ≈ 84° 45' E** |

## Why Accurate Time is Critical

| Time Error | Position Error (at equator) |
|------------|----------------------------|
| 1 second | 0.25 nautical miles |
| 4 seconds | 1 nautical mile |
| 1 minute | 15 nautical miles |
| 4 minutes | 60 nautical miles (1 degree) |

> *"The longitude problem was really a time problem. Once you can keep accurate time at sea, longitude becomes a matter of simple arithmetic."*

---

## Quick Reference: Longitude Formulas

### For Western Longitudes:
```
LHA = GHA - Longitude(W)
If result < 0°, add 360°

Longitude(W) = GHA - LHA
If result < 0°, add 360°
```

### For Eastern Longitudes:
```
LHA = GHA + Longitude(E)
If result > 360°, subtract 360°

Longitude(E) = LHA - GHA
If result < 0°, add 360°
```

### The Universal Rule:
```
LHA = GHA ± Longitude
(+ for East, - for West)

Always adjust to keep LHA between 0° and 360°
```

# Appendix B: Latitude by the Sun's Path Angle

## The Principle

The sun's daily path across the sky (its **diurnal arc**) is always parallel to the celestial equator. The angle this path makes with the horizon is directly related to the observer's latitude.

### The Key Relationship:

```
Angle of sun's path with horizon = 90° - |Latitude|
```

Or, solving for latitude:

```
Latitude = 90° - (angle of sun's path with horizon)
```

This works because the celestial equator meets the horizon at an angle equal to the **co-latitude** (90° minus latitude).

---

## Visual Understanding

## Methods to Measure the Sun's Path Angle

### Method 1: Two-Sight Plotting

1. Take a sun sight at sunrise (or morning)
2. Take another sight 1-2 hours later
3. Plot both positions on a chart
4. Draw a line connecting them - this is the sun's track
5. Measure the angle between this line and the horizon (east-west line)

**Example:**
```
First sight:  Altitude 15°, Azimuth 095°
Second sight: Altitude 35°, Azimuth 120°

Plot both positions relative to assumed position.
Connect with a line.
Measure angle of line from horizontal = Sun's path angle
```

### Method 2: Shadow Stick (Gnomon) Method

This ancient technique requires no instruments:

1. Place a vertical stick (gnomon) on flat ground
2. Mark the tip of the shadow at regular intervals (every 15-30 minutes)
3. Connect the shadow tip marks - they form a line
4. This line represents the sun's path projected onto the ground
5. The angle of this line from the east-west axis equals the sun's path angle

```
        N
        |
        |     × 10:00
        |   × 10:30        ← Shadow tips trace
        | × 11:00              the sun's path
   W ───┼─×─11:30──────── E
        | × 12:00
        |   × 12:30
        |     × 13:00
        |
        S

        Stick (gnomon) at center
```

**Note:** On the equinoxes, this line runs exactly east-west. On other dates, it curves slightly.

### Method 3: Direct Observation at Sunrise/Sunset

1. Watch the sun as it rises or sets
2. Note the angle of its path relative to the horizon
3. Use a simple inclinometer or protractor aligned with the horizon
4. Estimate the angle of the sun's trajectory

**Best conditions:**
- Clear horizon (at sea)
- Sunrise or sunset (path angle most visible)
- Lower latitudes (steeper angle, easier to measure)

---

## Worked Example

### Scenario:
You're shipwrecked on an unknown island in the Southern Ocean with no instruments except a protractor. By observing the sunrise, you estimate the sun's path makes a **55° angle** with the horizon. At noon, you notice the sun is to your **North**.

### Calculation:
```
Latitude = 90° - Sun's path angle
Latitude = 90° - 55°
Latitude = 35°
```

### Result:
You're at approximately **35° South latitude**.

*How do you know it's South? The sun bore North at noon, which only happens in the Southern Hemisphere (or in the tropics when the sun's declination is greater than your latitude).*

---

## Seasonal Correction

The basic formula assumes the celestial equator. For greater accuracy, account for the sun's declination:

### At Equinoxes (March 21, September 23):
- Sun is on celestial equator
- Formula works exactly: **Latitude = 90° - path angle**

### At Solstices and Other Dates:
The sun's path is offset from the celestial equator by its declination. The path angle still equals 90° - latitude, but the sun's **noon altitude** changes.

For the path angle method, the declination doesn't significantly affect the angle of the path - only where along that path the sun travels.

---

## The Amplitude Method (Related Technique)

The **Amplitude** is the bearing of the sun when it's exactly on the celestial horizon (rising or setting). This is related to the path angle method.

### Formula:
```
sin(Amplitude) = sin(Declination) / cos(Latitude)
```

Or solving for latitude:
```
cos(Latitude) = sin(Declination) / sin(Amplitude)
```

### What is Amplitude?
- The angular distance of the sun from the **east point** (at sunrise) or **west point** (at sunset)
- Measured along the horizon
- Named N or S depending on the sun's declination

### Example (Southern Hemisphere):
```
Date: January 15 (summer in Southern Hemisphere)
Sun's Declination: S 21.5°
Observed Amplitude: Sun rose at bearing 115° (25° south of east)

sin(25°) = sin(21.5°) / cos(Latitude)
cos(Latitude) = sin(21.5°) / sin(25°)
cos(Latitude) = 0.366 / 0.423
cos(Latitude) = 0.866
Latitude = arccos(0.866) = 30°
```

**Result:** Latitude is approximately **30° S**

*How do you know it's South? The sun rose south of east, and its declination is South (summer in Southern Hemisphere). In the Southern Hemisphere during summer, the sun rises and sets south of the east-west line.*

### Amplitude Table (Quick Reference)

For a body with declination = 20°:

| Latitude | Amplitude |
|----------|-----------|
| 0° | 20.0° |
| 10° | 20.3° |
| 20° | 21.3° |
| 30° | 23.1° |
| 40° | 26.1° |
| 50° | 31.1° |
| 60° | 40.0° |

---

## Practical Considerations

### Advantages:
- No sextant required (for shadow stick method)
- No accurate time required
- Works with simple observation
- Good emergency/survival technique

### Limitations:
- Less precise than sextant methods (typically ±2-5° accuracy)
- Requires clear view of horizon
- Better accuracy at lower latitudes
- Sunrise/sunset observation only
- Weather dependent

### Best Uses:
- Survival situations without instruments
- Cross-check against sextant observations
- Teaching the fundamentals of celestial navigation
- Historical/traditional navigation appreciation

---

## Historical Note

This method predates the sextant by millennia. **Polynesian navigators** used the angle of star paths (including the sun) to maintain latitude during long ocean voyages across the South Pacific. They memorized the rising and setting angles of key stars at different islands, allowing them to sail along "star paths" to their destinations.

The **Southern Cross** was particularly important - its angle above the horizon changes predictably with latitude, and its orientation helps find south. Pacific Islanders navigating between Hawaii, New Zealand, and Easter Island relied on these techniques for thousands of years.

> *"The Polynesians didn't just observe the stars - they understood their geometry. The angle of a star's rise told them their latitude as surely as any instrument. The Southern Cross was their compass, the sun's path their map."*

# Appendix C: Special Cases of the Astronomical Triangle

This appendix shows how the general spherical trigonometry equations of the PZX (astronomical) triangle reduce to simple formulas in special cases.

## The General Equations

The PZX triangle has three sides and three angles:

**Sides:**
- PZ = 90° - φ (co-latitude, where φ = observer's latitude)
- PX = 90° - δ (polar distance, where δ = declination)
- ZX = 90° - h (zenith distance, where h = altitude)

**Angles:**
- Angle at P = LHA (Local Hour Angle)
- Angle at Z = Az (Azimuth)
- Angle at X = q (parallactic angle)

**The fundamental equations (spherical law of cosines):**

```
cos(ZX) = cos(PZ)·cos(PX) + sin(PZ)·sin(PX)·cos(LHA)
```

Substituting the co-functions:

```
sin(h) = sin(φ)·sin(δ) + cos(φ)·cos(δ)·cos(LHA)    ... (1)
```

This is the **altitude equation** - the master equation of celestial navigation.

---

## Special Case 1: Meridian Passage (Noon Sight)

**Condition:** Body on the meridian → **LHA = 0°**

**Reduction:**

When LHA = 0°, cos(LHA) = cos(0°) = 1

Equation (1) becomes:
```
sin(h) = sin(φ)·sin(δ) + cos(φ)·cos(δ)·(1)
sin(h) = sin(φ)·sin(δ) + cos(φ)·cos(δ)
```

Using the cosine addition formula: cos(A - B) = cos(A)cos(B) + sin(A)sin(B)
```
sin(h) = cos(φ - δ)
```

Since sin(h) = cos(90° - h) = cos(ZD):
```
cos(ZD) = cos(φ - δ)
```

Therefore:
```
ZD = |φ - δ|
```

Or equivalently:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  φ = δ ± ZD  =  δ ± (90° - h)       │
│                                     │
│  Latitude = Declination ± Zenith Distance │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Result:** No spherical trigonometry needed! The triangle collapses to a straight line (P, Z, and X are collinear on the meridian).

---

## Special Case 2: Polaris (Body at the Celestial Pole)

**Condition:** Declination δ = 90° (exactly at the pole)

**Reduction:**

When δ = 90°:
- sin(δ) = sin(90°) = 1
- cos(δ) = cos(90°) = 0

Equation (1) becomes:
```
sin(h) = sin(φ)·(1) + cos(φ)·(0)·cos(LHA)
sin(h) = sin(φ)
```

Therefore:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  h = φ                  │
│                         │
│  Altitude = Latitude    │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Result:** The altitude of the celestial pole equals your latitude directly. (Polaris at δ ≈ 89.3° requires small corrections.)

---

## Special Case 3: Amplitude (Body on the Horizon)

**Condition:** Body rising or setting → **Altitude h = 0°**

**Reduction:**

When h = 0°, sin(h) = 0

Equation (1) becomes:
```
0 = sin(φ)·sin(δ) + cos(φ)·cos(δ)·cos(LHA)
```

Solving for cos(LHA):
```
cos(LHA) = -sin(φ)·sin(δ) / [cos(φ)·cos(δ)]
cos(LHA) = -tan(φ)·tan(δ)
```

At the moment of rising/setting, the azimuth measured from East (sunrise) or West (sunset) is called the **amplitude (A)**. The relationship between amplitude and azimuth:
- At sunrise: Az = 90° - A (measuring A north or south of due East)
- At sunset: Az = 270° + A

Using the azimuth formula at h = 0°:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  sin(A) = sin(δ) / cos(φ)           │
│                                     │
│  sin(Amplitude) = sin(Dec) / cos(Lat) │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Result:** One simple equation. If you know your latitude, observe the amplitude at sunrise/sunset to find the sun's declination (and hence the date). Or if you know the date (declination), find your latitude.

---

## Special Case 4: Body at the Zenith

**Condition:** Altitude h = 90° (body directly overhead)

**Reduction:**

When h = 90°:
- sin(h) = 1
- ZX = 0° (zenith distance is zero)

The triangle collapses to a point - the body IS at your zenith.

This means:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  φ = δ                  │
│  Longitude = GHA        │
│                         │
│  You are at the GP      │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Result:** Your position is the Geographic Position of the body. Latitude equals declination, longitude equals the Greenwich Hour Angle.

---

## Special Case 5: Prime Vertical Observation

**Condition:** Body due East or West → **Azimuth = 90° or 270°**

**Reduction:**

When the body is on the prime vertical, the PZX triangle has a right angle at the zenith (Z).

Using the spherical law of sines:
```
sin(PX) / sin(Az) = sin(ZX) / sin(P)
```

With Az = 90°, sin(Az) = 1, and converting to altitude/declination:
```
cos(δ) / 1 = cos(h) / sin(LHA)
```

Using the altitude equation with the prime vertical constraint:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  sin(h) = sin(δ) / sin(φ)           │
│                                     │
│  sin(Altitude) = sin(Dec) / sin(Lat) │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Result:** One equation. Time when a known star crosses your prime vertical to find latitude.

---

## Special Case 6: Observer at the Equator

**Condition:** Latitude φ = 0°

**Reduction:**

When φ = 0°:
- sin(φ) = 0
- cos(φ) = 1
- PZ = 90° (co-latitude equals 90°)

Equation (1) becomes:
```
sin(h) = (0)·sin(δ) + (1)·cos(δ)·cos(LHA)
sin(h) = cos(δ)·cos(LHA)
```

At meridian passage (LHA = 0°):
```
sin(h) = cos(δ)
h = 90° - |δ|
```

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Meridian Altitude = 90° - |Declination| │
│                                         │
│  All bodies rise and set vertically      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Result:** Right triangle geometry. The zenith is on the celestial equator.

---

## Special Case 7: Circumpolar Star at Culmination

**Condition:** Circumpolar star on the meridian (upper or lower transit)

**Reduction:**

For a circumpolar star, it never sets. At **upper culmination** (highest point, LHA = 0°):
```
h_upper = 90° - φ + δ    (for southern stars from southern latitudes)
```

At **lower culmination** (lowest point, LHA = 180°):
```
h_lower = φ + δ - 90°    (for southern stars from southern latitudes)
```

Adding these:
```
h_upper + h_lower = (90° - φ + δ) + (φ + δ - 90°)
h_upper + h_lower = 2δ
```

Subtracting:
```
h_upper - h_lower = (90° - φ + δ) - (φ + δ - 90°)
h_upper - h_lower = 180° - 2φ
```

Therefore:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  δ = (h_upper + h_lower) / 2                │
│                                             │
│  φ = 90° - (h_upper - h_lower) / 2          │
│                                             │
│  Latitude from averaging culmination altitudes │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Result:** Observe a circumpolar star at both culminations to find both latitude and the star's declination, with no time required.

## Summary: Why These Special Cases Matter

| Special Case | What Simplifies | Practical Use |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Meridian (LHA=0) | Triangle → line | Noon sight for latitude |
| Pole star (δ=90°) | Direct reading | Quick latitude check |
| Horizon (h=0°) | One trig equation | Amplitude for lat/dec |
| Zenith (h=90°) | Triangle → point | You're at the GP |
| Prime vertical | Right triangle | Latitude from timing |
| Equator (φ=0°) | Right triangle | Simplified geometry |
| Culminations | Algebra only | Lat without time |

These special cases were the foundation of practical celestial navigation for centuries. Navigators planned their observations to exploit these simplifications, avoiding complex spherical trigonometry whenever possible.

> *"A wise navigator seeks the special case. Why wrestle with spherical triangles when the noon sun gives latitude by simple addition?"*

# Appendix D: Position Fix from Sunrise/Sunset

This appendix describes how to obtain a complete position fix (latitude AND longitude) from a single sunrise or sunset observation by measuring both the **azimuth** (bearing) and the **time**.

## The Principle

At sunrise or sunset, the sun is on the horizon (altitude h = 0°). This special case allows us to extract two pieces of information from one event:

1. **Azimuth** → Latitude (via the amplitude formula)
2. **Time** → Longitude (via the hour angle calculation)

## Step 1: Amplitude → Latitude

The **amplitude** is the bearing of the sun measured from due East (at sunrise) or due West (at sunset), expressed as degrees North or South.

At h = 0°, the general altitude equation reduces to:

```
sin(Amplitude) = sin(Declination) / cos(Latitude)
```

Rearranging for latitude:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  cos(φ) = sin(δ) / sin(A)                       │
│                                                 │
│  Latitude = arccos( sin(Dec) / sin(Amplitude) ) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**To find amplitude from observed azimuth:**
- Sunrise: A = Azimuth - 90° (positive if north of E, negative if south)
- Sunset: A = Azimuth - 270° (positive if north of W, negative if south)

---

## Step 2: Time → Longitude

Once you have latitude, you can calculate the **Local Hour Angle (LHA)** at the moment of sunrise/sunset.

At h = 0°, the altitude equation gives:

```
0 = sin(φ)·sin(δ) + cos(φ)·cos(δ)·cos(LHA)
```

Solving for LHA:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  cos(LHA) = -tan(φ) · tan(δ)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

At sunset: LHA = arccos(-tan(φ)·tan(δ))
At sunrise: LHA = 360° - arccos(-tan(φ)·tan(δ))

**Finding Longitude:**

From the Nautical Almanac, look up the **Greenwich Hour Angle (GHA)** of the sun at your observed UTC time.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Longitude = GHA - LHA              │
│                                     │
│  (Adjust to range -180° to +180°)   │
│  West longitude is negative         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Complete Worked Example (Southern Hemisphere)

**Observation:**
- Date: December 21 (Summer Solstice)
- Event: Sunset
- Observed azimuth: 246° (compass corrected for variation)
- UTC time of sunset: 07:30 UTC

**Given:**
- Sun's declination on Dec 21: δ = -23.4° (from almanac)
- GHA of sun at 07:30 UTC: 290.5° (from almanac)

### Step 1: Calculate Amplitude

```
Azimuth = 246°
Amplitude = 246° - 270° = -24° (24° south of due west)
```

### Step 2: Calculate Latitude

```
cos(φ) = sin(δ) / sin(A)
cos(φ) = sin(-23.4°) / sin(-24°)
cos(φ) = (-0.397) / (-0.407)
cos(φ) = 0.975

φ = arccos(0.975) = 12.8°
```

Since both declination and amplitude are south (negative), we are in the Southern Hemisphere:

**Latitude = 12.8°S**

### Step 3: Calculate Local Hour Angle

```
cos(LHA) = -tan(φ) · tan(δ)
cos(LHA) = -tan(-12.8°) · tan(-23.4°)
cos(LHA) = -(-0.227) · (-0.433)
cos(LHA) = -0.098

LHA = arccos(-0.098) = 95.6°
```

### Step 4: Calculate Longitude

```
Longitude = GHA - LHA
Longitude = 290.5° - 95.6°
Longitude = 194.9°
```

Converting to standard notation (194.9° > 180°):
```
Longitude = 194.9° - 360° = -165.1°
```

Or: **Longitude = 165.1°E**

### Result

**Position: 12.8°S, 165.1°E**

This position is in the South Pacific, near Vanuatu.

## Corrections Required

For accurate results, apply these corrections:

| Correction | Typical Value | Effect |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| Atmospheric refraction | ~34' | Sun appears higher than it is |
| Sun's semi-diameter | ~16' | Time when center crosses horizon |
| Dip of horizon | Varies with height of eye | Higher eye = earlier sunset |
| Compass deviation | Varies | Correct azimuth reading |
| Magnetic variation | Varies by location | Convert magnetic to true bearing |

**Refraction correction:** The sun appears about 34 arcminutes higher than its true position when on the horizon. The visible sunset occurs when the sun's true altitude is about -50' (below the geometric horizon).

---

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages

- Complete position fix from a single event
- Available twice daily (sunrise and sunset)
- No noon sight required
- Uses simple equipment (compass, watch)
- Good backup method when noon is cloudy

### Limitations

- Requires clear horizon (no clouds, land, or ships in the way)
- Less accurate than multiple-sight fixes
- Sensitive to refraction variations (temperature, pressure)
- Requires accurate compass and timing
- Amplitude method fails near equinoxes when declination ≈ 0°

---

## Historical Use

This method was particularly valuable for:

1. **Overcast days** - When the noon sun was obscured but horizon was clear at sunrise/sunset
2. **Confirming position** - Cross-checking against dead reckoning
3. **Coastal navigation** - When timing and bearing were easy to observe
4. **Emergency navigation** - When limited observations were possible

> *"The prudent navigator takes every sight the heavens offer. A sunrise amplitude and time, though less precise than a meridian altitude, may be the only fix a cloudy day allows."*

---

## Upper Limb Method (Recommended)

In practice, it's easier to observe the precise moment when the **upper limb of the sun disappears** below the horizon (sunset) or **first appears** above it (sunrise), rather than estimating when the center crosses the horizon.

### Why the Upper Limb is Better

| Observation | Difficulty |
|-------------|------------|
| Center at horizon | Must estimate - center is obscured |
| Upper limb at horizon | Precise - watch last/first sliver |

### The Correction

When the upper limb touches the horizon, the sun's **center** is actually below the geometric horizon due to:

| Effect | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Semi-diameter (radius of sun) | -16' |
| Atmospheric refraction | -34' |
| **Total correction** | **-50'** (≈ -0.83°) |

So instead of h = 0°, we use **h = -50'** in the altitude equation.

### Modified Equations

**Latitude (unchanged):** The azimuth changes very slowly near the horizon, so use the same amplitude formula:

```
cos(φ) = sin(δ) / sin(A)
```

**Longitude (modified):** The hour angle formula becomes:

```

│  cos(LHA) = [sin(-50') - sin(φ)·sin(δ)] / [cos(φ)·cos(δ)]        │
│                                                                   │

└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Worked Example: Upper Limb Method

**Observation:**
- Date: December 21 (δ = -23.4°)
- Event: Upper limb disappears below horizon
- Observed azimuth: 246°
- UTC time: 07:32 UTC
- GHA of sun at 07:32 UTC: 291.0° (from almanac)

**Step 1: Latitude (same as before)**
```
Amplitude = 246° - 270° = -24° (24° south of west)
cos(φ) = sin(-23.4°) / sin(-24°)
cos(φ) = (-0.397) / (-0.407) = 0.975
φ = arccos(0.975) = 12.8°S
```

**Step 2: Hour Angle (modified formula)**
```
cos(LHA) = [sin(-50') - sin(φ)·sin(δ)] / [cos(φ)·cos(δ)]
cos(LHA) = [-0.0145 - sin(-12.8°)·sin(-23.4°)] / [cos(-12.8°)·cos(-23.4°)]
cos(LHA) = [-0.0145 - (-0.222)(-0.397)] / [(0.975)(0.917)]
cos(LHA) = [-0.0145 - 0.0881] / [0.894]
cos(LHA) = -0.1027 / 0.894
cos(LHA) = -0.1149

LHA = arccos(-0.1149) = 96.6°
```

**Step 3: Longitude**
```
Longitude = GHA - LHA
Longitude = 291.0° - 96.6° = 194.4°
Longitude = 194.4° - 360° = -165.6°

Longitude = 165.6°E
```

**Result: 12.8°S, 165.6°E** (South Pacific, near Vanuatu)

### Comparison: Geometric vs Upper Limb

| Method | Assumed h | LHA | Longitude |
|--------|-----------|-----|-----------|
| Geometric (h = 0°) | 0° | 95.6° | 165.1°E |
| Upper Limb (h = -50') | -0.83° | 96.6° | 165.6°E |
| **Difference** | | 1.0° | ~30 nm |

The difference of about 30 nautical miles demonstrates why using the correct method matters for accurate navigation.

### Summary: When to Use Each Formula

| Observation | Use h = | LHA Formula |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Geometric sunset (center at horizon) | 0° | cos(LHA) = -tan(φ)·tan(δ) |
| **Visible sunset (upper limb disappears)** | **-50'** | **cos(LHA) = [-0.0145 - sin(φ)sin(δ)] / [cos(φ)cos(δ)]** |
| Visible sunrise (upper limb appears) | -50' | LHA = 360° - arccos(...) |

## Path Angle Method (Time-Lapse Observation)

A time-lapse of sunrise or sunset reveals the **angle of the sun's path** relative to the horizon. This angle is directly related to your latitude and provides an alternative method for position determination - one that doesn't require a compass.

### The Principle

The sun doesn't rise or set vertically (except at the equator). The angle its path makes with the horizon depends on your latitude:

| Latitude | Path Angle | Sun's Motion |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Equator (0°) | 90° | Rises/sets vertically |
| 30° | ~60° | Steep diagonal |
| 45° | ~45° | 45° diagonal |
| 60° | ~30° | Shallow angle |
| Near poles | ~0° | Skims along horizon |

### The Formula

The relationship between path angle (θ), latitude (φ), and declination (δ):

│                                                             │
│      sin(θ) = cos(φ) × cos(δ)                               │
│                                                             │
│      cos(φ) = sin(θ) / cos(δ)                               │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why This Works

The sun's apparent motion is caused by Earth's rotation. The angle of this motion relative to your horizon depends on:

1. **Your latitude** - determines the angle between the celestial equator and your horizon
2. **The sun's declination** - determines how far north/south of the celestial equator the sun is

At the equator, the celestial equator passes directly overhead, so all celestial objects rise and set perpendicular to the horizon. At higher latitudes, they rise and set at increasingly shallow angles.

### Complete Position Fix from Time-Lapse

A single time-lapse video captures TWO independent measurements:

| From the Time-Lapse | Measurement | Result |
|---------------------|-------------|--------|
| Angle of sun's path | Path angle θ | **Latitude** |
| Time when sun touches horizon | UTC time | **Longitude** |

### Worked Example: Equinox

**Observation:**
- Date: March 21 (Equinox, δ ≈ 0°)
- Path angle measured from time-lapse: 55°
- Sun sets toward the west-northwest (Southern Hemisphere indicated)
- UTC time when upper limb disappears: 06:15 UTC

**Step 1: Latitude from path angle**

At equinox, the simple formula applies:
```
Latitude = 90° - path angle
Latitude = 90° - 55° = 35°
```
Sun setting north of west indicates Southern Hemisphere: **Latitude = 35°S**

**Step 2: Longitude from time**

Using h = -50' for upper limb observation:
```
cos(LHA) = [-0.0145 - sin(-35°)·sin(0°)] / [cos(-35°)·cos(0°)]
cos(LHA) = [-0.0145 - 0] / [0.819 × 1]
cos(LHA) = -0.0177
LHA = arccos(-0.0177) = 91.0°
```

From almanac: GHA of sun at 06:15 UTC ≈ 272.5°
```
Longitude = GHA - LHA = 272.5° - 91.0° = 181.5°
Longitude = 181.5° - 360° = -178.5° = 178.5°E
```

**Result: 35°S, 178.5°E** (Near New Zealand)

### Worked Example: Non-Equinox

**Observation:**
- Date: December 21 (δ = -23.4°)
- Path angle measured: 48°
- UTC time of sunset: 07:45 UTC

**Step 1: Latitude from path angle**
```
cos(φ) = sin(θ) / cos(δ)
cos(φ) = sin(48°) / cos(-23.4°)
cos(φ) = 0.743 / 0.918
cos(φ) = 0.809

φ = arccos(0.809) = 36.0°
```

Southern Hemisphere (summer solstice, sun high): **Latitude = 36°S**

**Step 2: Longitude from time**
```
cos(LHA) = [-0.0145 - sin(-36°)·sin(-23.4°)] / [cos(-36°)·cos(-23.4°)]
cos(LHA) = [-0.0145 - (-0.588)(-0.397)] / [(0.809)(0.918)]
cos(LHA) = [-0.0145 - 0.233] / [0.743]
cos(LHA) = -0.333

LHA = arccos(-0.333) = 109.5°
```

From almanac: GHA at 07:45 UTC ≈ 294.5°
```
Longitude = 294.5° - 109.5° = 185.0°
Longitude = 185.0° - 360° = -175.0° = 175°E
```

**Result: 36°S, 175°E** (East of New Zealand)

### How to Measure Path Angle from Time-Lapse

**Method 1: Direct measurement**
1. Take a time-lapse video of sunrise/sunset
2. In image editing software, draw a line along the sun's path
3. Measure the angle from horizontal with a protractor tool

**Method 2: Two-point calculation**
1. Note the sun's position at two times during the time-lapse
2. Calculate the angle: θ = arctan(Δy / Δx)
   where Δy = vertical change, Δx = horizontal change

**Method 3: Shadow stick**
1. Place a vertical stick on level ground
2. Mark the shadow tip at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes)
3. The shadow path is perpendicular to the sun's path
4. Measure the shadow path angle and add 90°

### Advantages of the Path Angle Method

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **No compass needed** | You measure an angle, not a bearing |
| **Works with partial view** | Only need to see part of the sun's path |
| **Time-lapse captures both measurements** | Path angle AND time in one observation |
| **Intuitive** | Easy to see and understand from video |
| **Ancient method** | Polynesian navigators used this technique |

### Limitations

| Limitation | Mitigation |
|------------|------------|
| Requires clear horizon | Choose observing location carefully |
| Camera must be level | Use spirit level or phone app |
| Less precise than sextant | Best as backup or confirmation method |
| Atmospheric effects | Take multiple measurements |
| Fails near equinoxes at equator | Path is vertical, hard to measure angle |

### Path Angle Reference Table

**At Equinoxes (δ = 0°):**

| Path Angle | Latitude |
|------------|----------|
| 90° | 0° (Equator) |
| 80° | 10° |
| 70° | 20° |
| 60° | 30° |
| 55° | 35° |
| 50° | 40° |
| 45° | 45° |
| 40° | 50° |
| 30° | 60° |

**Adjustment for declination:** At solstices (δ = ±23.4°), the path angle is steeper by a few degrees compared to equinox values at the same latitude.

### Historical Note: Polynesian Navigation

The Polynesian voyagers of the Pacific used the angle of star paths (including the sun) to maintain their latitude during long ocean crossings. They memorized the rising and setting angles of key stars at different islands, creating mental "star compasses" that allowed navigation across thousands of miles of open ocean.

The Southern Cross was particularly valuable because:
- Its path angle indicated latitude
- Its orientation helped find south
- It was visible year-round from most of the South Pacific

> *"The angle at which a star rises tells you where you are on the ocean. The old navigators knew this in their bones - they could feel their latitude in the tilt of the sky."*
> — Traditional Polynesian navigation wisdom

# Appendix E: Vector Derivation of Spherical Trigonometry

This appendix derives the spherical law of cosines and spherical law of sines using vector algebra (dot products and cross products). This approach provides geometric insight into why these formulas work and connects spherical trigonometry to linear algebra.

## Setup: Spherical Triangle as Vectors

Consider a unit sphere centered at the origin O. Three points A, B, C on the sphere define a spherical triangle. Each point can be represented by a unit vector from the origin:

- **a** = unit vector to vertex A
- **b** = unit vector to vertex B
- **c** = unit vector to vertex C

Since these are unit vectors: |**a**| = |**b**| = |**c**| = 1

### Sides as Dot Products

The sides of a spherical triangle are great circle arcs. The angular length of each side equals the angle between the corresponding vectors:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Side a (opposite vertex A):  cos(a) = b · c        │
│  Side b (opposite vertex B):  cos(b) = a · c        │
│  Side c (opposite vertex C):  cos(c) = a · b        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This follows directly from the definition of the dot product:
```
u · v = |u| |v| cos(θ)
```
For unit vectors, this simplifies to: **u** · **v** = cos(θ)

## Deriving the Spherical Law of Cosines

The spherical angle at vertex A is the dihedral angle between planes OAB and OAC.

### Step 1: Find Normal Vectors to the Planes

The normal vector to a plane containing two vectors is their cross product:

- Normal to plane OAB: **n₁** = **a** × **b**
- Normal to plane OAC: **n₂** = **a** × **c**

### Step 2: Relate the Angle to the Dot Product of Normals

The angle A between the planes satisfies:
```
n₁ · n₂ = |n₁| |n₂| cos(A)

(a × b) · (a × c) = |a × b| |a × c| cos(A)
```

### Step 3: Apply the Vector Identity

Use the identity for the dot product of two cross products:
```
(u × v) · (w × x) = (u · w)(v · x) - (u · x)(v · w)
```

Applying this with u = w = **a**, v = **b**, x = **c**:
```
(a × b) · (a × c) = (a · a)(b · c) - (a · c)(a · b)
```

### Step 4: Substitute Unit Vector Property

Since **a** is a unit vector: **a** · **a** = 1
```
(a × b) · (a × c) = (1)(b · c) - (a · c)(a · b)
                  = cos(a) - cos(b)cos(c)
```

### Step 5: Calculate Cross Product Magnitudes

For unit vectors, the magnitude of the cross product gives the sine of the angle:
```
|a × b| = |a| |b| sin(c) = (1)(1)sin(c) = sin(c)
|a × c| = |a| |c| sin(b) = (1)(1)sin(b) = sin(b)
```

### Step 6: Combine the Results

Substituting into the equation from Step 2:
```
cos(a) - cos(b)cos(c) = sin(b) sin(c) cos(A)
```

Rearranging:

```

│   cos(a) = cos(b)cos(c) + sin(b)sin(c)cos(A)               │
│                                                             │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Cyclic Permutations

By symmetry, cycling through the vertices gives:
```
cos(a) = cos(b)cos(c) + sin(b)sin(c)cos(A)
cos(b) = cos(c)cos(a) + sin(c)sin(a)cos(B)
cos(c) = cos(a)cos(b) + sin(a)sin(b)cos(C)
```

## Deriving the Spherical Law of Sines

### Step 1: Define the Scalar Triple Product

The scalar triple product of three vectors gives the signed volume of the parallelepiped they span:

```
V = a · (b × c) = b · (c × a) = c · (a × b)
```

This quantity is the same regardless of which cyclic permutation we use.

### Step 2: Cross Product of Cross Products

Consider the cross product of our normal vectors:
```
(a × b) × (a × c)
```

Using the vector identity (BAC-CAB rule):
```
(u × v) × w = (u · w)v - (v · w)u
```

We can show that:
```
(a × b) × (a × c) = [(a × b) · c] a - [(a × b) · a] c
```

Since (**a** × **b**) is perpendicular to **a**, we have (**a** × **b**) · **a** = 0:
```
(a × b) × (a × c) = [(a × b) · c] a = V · a
```

### Step 3: Calculate the Magnitude

Taking magnitudes:
```
|(a × b) × (a × c)| = |V| · |a| = |V|
```

### Step 4: Alternative Expression for the Magnitude

The magnitude of a cross product of two vectors equals:
```
|u × v| = |u| |v| sin(θ)
```

where θ is the angle between them. The angle between (**a** × **b**) and (**a** × **c**) is the spherical angle A, so:
```
|(a × b) × (a × c)| = |a × b| |a × c| sin(A)
                    = sin(c) · sin(b) · sin(A)
```

### Step 5: Equate the Two Expressions

From Steps 3 and 4:
```
|V| = sin(b) sin(c) sin(A)
```

### Step 6: Apply Cyclic Symmetry

By the same reasoning at each vertex:
```
|V| = sin(b) sin(c) sin(A)
|V| = sin(c) sin(a) sin(B)
|V| = sin(a) sin(b) sin(C)
```

### Step 7: Derive the Law of Sines

Since all three expressions equal |V|:
```
sin(b) sin(c) sin(A) = sin(c) sin(a) sin(B) = sin(a) sin(b) sin(C)
```

Dividing each term by sin(a) sin(b) sin(c):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │
│   sin(A)     sin(B)     sin(C)         |V|                 │
│   ────── = ────────  = ────────  = ─────────────────       │
│   sin(a)     sin(b)     sin(c)     sin(a)sin(b)sin(c)      │
│                                                             │
│   SPHERICAL LAW OF SINES                                    │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Geometric Interpretation

### The Scalar Triple Product V

The quantity |V| = |**a** · (**b** × **c**)| has a beautiful geometric meaning:

- It equals the volume of the parallelepiped formed by vectors **a**, **b**, **c**
- For unit vectors on a sphere, it relates to the "size" of the spherical triangle
- It appears as the common numerator in the law of sines

### Connection to Spherical Excess

The spherical excess E = A + B + C - π (the amount by which the angles exceed 180°) is related to the area of the spherical triangle:

```
Area = E × R²  (for a sphere of radius R)
```

The scalar triple product V is connected to this excess through:
```
tan(E/4) = |V| / (1 + cos(a) + cos(b) + cos(c))
```

## Why This Matters for Navigation

The vector approach reveals the fundamental structure:

1. **Sides** of a spherical triangle are **dot products** (angles between position vectors on the celestial sphere)

2. **Angles** of a spherical triangle come from **cross products** (angles between great circle planes)

3. The **scalar triple product** V is the geometric "glue" connecting all parts of the triangle

For the PZX navigation triangle:
- The position vectors point to the Pole (P), Zenith (Z), and celestial body (X)
- The sides (co-lat, co-dec, zenith distance) are dot products of these vectors
- The angles (LHA, azimuth, parallactic angle) are dihedral angles between planes

This explains why spherical trigonometry, though seemingly complex, has such elegant formulas - they're all manifestations of basic vector operations on the unit sphere.

## Application: The Altitude Equation

Starting from the spherical law of cosines:
```
cos(a) = cos(b)cos(c) + sin(b)sin(c)cos(A)
```

For the PZX triangle with:
- Side PZ = 90° - φ (co-latitude)
- Side PX = 90° - δ (co-declination)
- Side ZX = 90° - h (co-altitude = zenith distance)
- Angle at P = LHA

Substituting:
```
cos(90° - h) = cos(90° - φ)cos(90° - δ) + sin(90° - φ)sin(90° - δ)cos(LHA)
```

Using co-function identities (cos(90° - x) = sin(x), sin(90° - x) = cos(x)):
```
sin(h) = sin(φ)sin(δ) + cos(φ)cos(δ)cos(LHA)
```

This is the **altitude equation** - derived directly from the vector-based spherical law of cosines!

## Historical Note

While the spherical laws were known to ancient astronomers (Menelaus, Ptolemy, Islamic mathematicians), the vector derivation came much later:

- **Josiah Willard Gibbs** (1880s) developed modern vector analysis
- The vector approach to spherical trigonometry emerged in the early 20th century
- It's now standard in celestial mechanics, satellite navigation, and computer graphics

The vector method is computationally efficient for modern applications - GPS receivers and planetarium software use these formulas in their vector form.
