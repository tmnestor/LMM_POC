# Vision-Language Model Prompting Strategy

## Research-Based Approach

Based on analysis of "LLMs Get Lost In Multi-Turn Conversation" (arXiv:2505.06120) and implementation in our LMM_POC framework.

## Key Research Findings

### Multi-Turn Performance Degradation
- **39% average performance drop** in multi-turn conversations across all tested LLMs
- Models make **premature assumptions** and get "lost" when they take wrong turns
- **Poor error recovery**: Once lost, models don't self-correct effectively
- **Answer bloat**: Responses get progressively longer and less focused in conversations

### Core Problems Identified
1. **Premature answer attempts**: Models try to generate solutions with incomplete information
2. **Overreliance on early responses**: Models stick to initial (often incorrect) interpretations
3. **Assumption propagation**: Wrong assumptions in early turns compound throughout conversation

## Our Strategic Response

### ✅ **Single-Turn Architecture (OPTIMAL)**

Our current approach is **research-validated optimal**:

```python
# GOOD: Single comprehensive extraction
def process_single_image(image_path):
    prompt = get_extraction_prompt()  # All 25 fields specified
    result = model.generate(image, prompt)
    return parse_extraction_response(result)
```

**Benefits:**
- No multi-turn degradation risk
- Complete specification prevents assumptions
- Consistent performance across documents
- No conversation state management needed

### ❌ **Patterns We Correctly Avoid**

```python
# BAD: Multi-turn refinement (would cause 39% degradation)
def process_image_with_refinement(image_path):
    initial_result = extract_basic_fields(image)
    clarified_result = clarify_missing_fields(image, initial_result)  # ❌ Performance drop
    validated_result = validate_and_correct(image, clarified_result)  # ❌ Compounds errors
    return validated_result
```

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. **Comprehensive Single-Pass Prompts**

```yaml
# field_schema.yaml - Research-informed constraints
critical_instructions:
  - "CRITICAL: Do NOT guess or infer values not clearly visible"
  - "CRITICAL: Do NOT attempt to calculate or derive missing information"  
  - "CRITICAL: Use EXACT text as it appears - no paraphrasing"
```

**Rationale**: Prevents the "premature assumption" problem identified in research.

### 2. **Explicit Anti-Assumption Language**

```yaml
# Prevent models from "taking wrong turns"
focus_instruction: "CRITICAL: Only extract values clearly visible - do NOT calculate or infer missing amounts."
```

**Research Connection**: Directly addresses the paper's finding that models make premature attempts to fill incomplete information.

### 3. **Complete Field Specification**

```yaml
# All 25 fields with detailed instructions
fields:
  - name: "BUSINESS_ABN"
    instruction: "[11-digit Australian Business Number or NOT_FOUND]"
    cognitive_context: "11 digit number structured as 9 digit identifier with two leading check digits"
```

**Rationale**: Eliminates need for clarification questions that would trigger multi-turn degradation.

## Model-Specific Optimizations

### Llama-3.2-Vision Prompts
```yaml
llama:
  single_pass:
    critical_instructions:
      - "Start immediately with DOCUMENT_TYPE"
      - "Stop immediately after TOTAL_AMOUNT"
      - "Do not add explanations or comments"
```

**Strategy**: Strict boundaries prevent the "answer bloat" phenomenon.

### InternVL3 Prompts
```yaml
internvl3:
  single_pass:
    anti_assumption_rules:
      - "Extract only what you can clearly see - no inference"
      - "Do NOT attempt calculations during extraction"
```

**Strategy**: Leverages InternVL3's concise style while preventing assumption errors.

## Validation Approach

### Separate Extraction and Validation
```python
# GOOD: Sequential separation
extracted_data = model.extract_fields(image)        # No assumptions
validation_results = validate_business_logic(extracted_data)  # Separate process
```

**Research Insight**: Business logic validation happens **after** extraction, not during, to prevent models from making assumptions during the extraction phase.

### Field Interdependency Checks
```yaml
# validation_rules.yaml - Post-extraction validation
total_sum_validation:
  description: "TOTAL should equal SUBTOTAL + GST"
  fields: ["SUBTOTAL_AMOUNT", "GST_AMOUNT", "TOTAL_AMOUNT"]
```

**Strategy**: Validation is separated from extraction to maintain single-turn performance.

## Performance Impact

### Measured Benefits
- **Consistent accuracy**: No multi-turn degradation
- **Predictable performance**: Same prompt structure for all documents  
- **Error isolation**: Failed extractions don't affect subsequent documents
- **Scalable processing**: No conversation state management overhead

### Avoided Risks
- **-39% accuracy drop**: Multi-turn conversation degradation
- **Assumption propagation**: Errors compounding across turns
- **Answer bloat**: Increasingly verbose and unfocused responses

## Production Recommendations

### ✅ **DO**
- Use comprehensive single-turn prompts with all fields specified
- Include explicit anti-assumption language in all prompts
- Separate extraction from validation processes
- Specify exact output formats to prevent answer bloat
- Test prompt completeness to minimize clarification needs

### ❌ **DON'T**
- Implement multi-turn field refinement or clarification
- Allow models to validate or correct their own extractions
- Use conversational interfaces for structured data extraction
- Rely on models to infer missing information
- Implement "smart" fallbacks that involve additional turns

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics
- **Single-turn success rate**: Percentage of successful extractions without retry
- **Field completeness**: Average fields extracted per document
- **Format compliance**: Adherence to specified output structure
- **Assumption rate**: Frequency of inferred vs explicitly visible data

### Continuous Improvement
- Monitor for prompt completeness gaps that might trigger assumptions
- Update field instructions based on common extraction errors
- Maintain strict single-turn architecture despite feature pressure
- Validate new field additions don't introduce ambiguity
