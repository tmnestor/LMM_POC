```yaml
# field_schema.yaml lines 219, 228, 233, etc.
temperature: 0.0
```
**Research Support**: IBM (2024) - "For most factual use cases such as data extraction, the temperature of 0 is best"

**Codebase Validation**: All 8 groups correctly implement `temperature: 0.0`, ensuring deterministic output for factual extraction tasks.

#### 2. **Entity-Specific Group Organization**
```yaml
# field_schema.yaml lines 274-285
detailed_grouped:
  name: "8-Group Detailed Extraction"
  groups: [critical, monetary, dates, business_entity, payer_info, banking, item_details, metadata]
```
**Research Support**: Follows entity-specific instruction patterns from Polat et al. (2025)

#### 3. **Anti-Assumption Language (InternVL3)**
```yaml
# field_schema.yaml lines 520-523
anti_assumption_rules:
  - "Extract only what you can clearly see - no inference"
  - "Do NOT attempt calculations or cross-field validation during extraction"
```
**Research Support**: Directly implements findings from "LLMs Get Lost In Multi-Turn Conversation" study preventing premature assumptions.

### ðŸ”§ Critical Enhancement Opportunities

## Detailed Recommendations

### 1. **Explicit Format Requirements Enhancement**

#### Current Implementation Gap
```yaml
# field_schema.yaml line 212
instruction: "[total amount in dollars with 2 decimals (e.g. $58.62) or NOT_FOUND]"
```

#### Research-Backed Improvement
**Add formal schema definitions** based on Unstract (2024) and Databricks (2024) approaches:

```yaml
# Recommended addition to field_schema.yaml
field_schemas:
  monetary:
    type: "number"
    format: "currency"
    regex_pattern: "^\$\d+\.\d{2}$"
    examples: ["$58.62", "$1,234.56", "$0.99"]
    validation_rules:
      - "Must include $ symbol"
      - "Exactly 2 decimal places"
      - "No spaces between $ and digits"
    
  abn:
    type: "string"
    format: "australian_business_number"
    regex_pattern: "^\d{2}\s?\d{3}\s?\d{3}\s?\d{3}$"
    examples: ["12 345 678 901", "12345678901"]
    validation_rules:
      - "Exactly 11 digits total"
      - "May include spaces in format XX XXX XXX XXX"
    
  date:
    type: "string"
    format: "date"
    regex_pattern: "^\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{4}$"
    examples: ["15/03/2024", "01/12/2025"]
    validation_rules:
      - "DD/MM/YYYY format only"
      - "Use leading zeros for single digits"

  phone:
    type: "string"
    format: "australian_phone"
    regex_pattern: "^0[2-9]\d{8}$"
    examples: ["0298765432", "0412345678"]
    validation_rules:
      - "Exactly 10 digits including area code"
      - "Must start with 0"
```

**Implementation Location**: Add after line 213 in `field_schema.yaml`

**Research Reference**: Databricks (2024) - "Simply write a JSON schema, which is then passed into the LLM call as an additional argument"

### 2. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting Integration**

#### Current Implementation Gap
Basic instructions lack reasoning chains for complex field extraction.

#### Research-Backed Enhancement
**Add CoT methodology** based on Polat et al. (2025):

```yaml
# Recommended addition to field_schema.yaml
extraction_methodologies:
  abn_extraction:
    description: "Step-by-step ABN identification process"
    steps:
      step1: "Scan document header and business details section"
      step2: "Look for 11-digit numbers with 'ABN' label"
      step3: "Verify format: XX XXX XXX XXX or 11 consecutive digits"
      step4: "Confirm it's not BSB (6 digits) or phone (10 digits)"
      step5: "Extract exact digits, preserve spacing if present"
    
  monetary_extraction:
    description: "Financial amount identification with validation"
    steps:
      step1: "Identify document sections: totals, line items, taxes"
      step2: "Look for $ symbols and decimal patterns"
      step3: "Distinguish between unit prices and line totals"
      step4: "Verify decimal places (exactly 2 for currency)"
      step5: "Cross-reference with field labels (Total, GST, Subtotal)"
    
  line_item_extraction:
    description: "Structured list extraction methodology"
    steps:
      step1: "Identify line item table or list structure"
      step2: "Extract descriptions in order: product names only"
      step3: "Extract quantities in same order: numbers only"
      step4: "Extract unit prices in same order: individual prices, not totals"
      step5: "Format as comma-separated values, one line per field type"
```

**Implementation Location**: Add after line 377 in `field_schema.yaml`

**Research Reference**: Polat et al. (2025) - "Think step by step" methodology with explicit reasoning chains

### 3. **Self-Consistency Validation Framework**

#### Current Implementation Gap
No validation prompts for extracted data quality assurance.

#### Research-Backed Enhancement
**Add validation framework** based on Polat et al. (2025):

```yaml
# Recommended addition to field_schema.yaml
self_validation_framework:
  description: "Post-extraction validation prompts for quality assurance"
  
  critical_field_validation:
    abn_check:
      prompt: "Before finalizing ABN: Count digits (must be exactly 11). Verify it's in business header, not contact section. Confirm it's labeled as ABN."
      severity: "critical"
    
    total_amount_check:
      prompt: "Before finalizing TOTAL_AMOUNT: Is this the final amount due? Does it include tax? Is decimal formatting correct (exactly 2 places)?"
      severity: "critical"
  
  mathematical_consistency:
    subtotal_gst_total:
      prompt: "If all three values present: Does SUBTOTAL + GST â‰ˆ TOTAL (within $0.02)? If not, re-examine each amount."
      fields: ["SUBTOTAL_AMOUNT", "GST_AMOUNT", "TOTAL_AMOUNT"]
      tolerance: 0.02
    
    gst_percentage:
      prompt: "If GST and SUBTOTAL present: Is GST approximately 10% of SUBTOTAL? Australian standard GST rate is 10%."
      expected_ratio: 0.10
      tolerance_range: [0.095, 0.105]
  
  format_consistency:
    date_format:
      prompt: "Before finalizing dates: Are they in DD/MM/YYYY format? Convert if necessary."
      standard_format: "DD/MM/YYYY"
    
    currency_format:
      prompt: "Before finalizing monetary values: Do they include $ symbol and exactly 2 decimal places?"
      required_format: "$X.XX"
```

**Implementation Location**: Add after line 413 in `field_schema.yaml`

**Research Reference**: Polat et al. (2025) - "Think like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples"

### 4. **Enhanced Null Value Strategy**

#### Current Implementation
```yaml
# field_schema.yaml various lines
instruction: "[field description or NOT_FOUND]"
```

#### Research-Backed Enhancement
**Strengthen null value guidance** based on Unstract (2024):

```yaml
# Recommended addition to field_schema.yaml
null_value_strategy:
  principle: "NOT_FOUND is better than guessed values"
  description: "Research-validated approach to handling missing or unclear information"
  
  use_not_found_when:
    - "Text is blurry, partially obscured, or low quality"
    - "Multiple possible interpretations exist"
    - "Field would require calculation or inference"
    - "Information appears to be present but is illegible"
    - "Similar-looking text exists but doesn't match field requirements"
  
  never_guess_for:
    - "BUSINESS_ABN: Never guess digit sequences"
    - "TOTAL_AMOUNT: Never calculate from line items during extraction"
    - "BANK_BSB_NUMBER: Never confuse with ABN or phone numbers"
    - "LINE_ITEM_PRICES: Never calculate from quantities Ã— unit prices"
  
  quality_indicators:
    high_confidence: "Text is clearly visible and unambiguous"
    medium_confidence: "Text is visible but may have minor OCR issues"
    low_confidence: "Text is partially visible or has interpretation ambiguity - use NOT_FOUND"
```

**Research Reference**: Unstract (2024) - "Remember, in LLM applications, a null value is always better than a wrong value"

### 5. **Output Format Standardization**

#### Current Implementation Gap
Inconsistent format specifications across different field types.

#### Research-Backed Enhancement
**Add comprehensive format standards** addressing research-identified variation issues:

```yaml
# Recommended addition to field_schema.yaml
output_format_standards:
  description: "Standardized formats to prevent variation issues identified in research"
  
  date_standardization:
    required_format: "DD/MM/YYYY"
    examples:
      correct: ["15/03/2024", "01/12/2025", "31/01/2024"]
      incorrect: ["March 15, 2024", "15-03-2024", "2024/03/15"]
    conversion_rules:
      - "Convert 'March 15, 2024' to '15/03/2024'"
      - "Convert '15-03-2024' to '15/03/2024'"
      - "Use leading zeros for single-digit days/months"
  
  monetary_standardization:
    required_format: "$X.XX"
    rules:
      - "Always include dollar sign ($)"
      - "Exactly 2 decimal places"
      - "No spaces between $ and digits"
      - "Use commas for thousands (e.g., $1,234.56)"
    examples:
      correct: ["$58.62", "$1,234.56", "$0.99"]
      incorrect: ["$58.6", "58.62", "$58", "$ 58.62"]
  
  phone_standardization:
    required_format: "10 digits with area code"
    examples:
      correct: ["0298765432", "0412345678"]
      incorrect: ["(02) 9876 5432", "02 9876 5432", "98765432"]
    rules:
      - "Remove spaces, brackets, and hyphens"
      - "Maintain area code (first 2-3 digits after 0)"
  
  list_standardization:
    required_format: "Comma-separated values on single line"
    examples:
      line_items: "Rice 1kg, Cheese Block 500g, Frozen Peas 1kg"
      quantities: "3, 3, 3, 1"
      prices: "$3.80, $8.50, $4.20"
    rules:
      - "One complete line per field type"
      - "Comma and space separation"
      - "No multiple blocks or repeated field headers"
```
