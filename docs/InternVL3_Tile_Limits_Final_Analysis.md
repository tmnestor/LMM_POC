# InternVL3 Tile Processing Limits - Final Analysis

**Critical Discovery Date**: September 29, 2025
**Analysis Type**: Empirical testing on V100 and H200 GPUs
**Root Cause**: 1792 embedding architectural constraint in InternVL3-8B

## Executive Summary

Through extensive testing, we discovered that InternVL3-8B has a hard architectural limit of **1792 embeddings** for vision processing. Even conservative settings like 560px + 6 tiles generate **2800 embeddings** (56% over the limit), causing runtime failures. This document provides the definitive analysis of safe boundaries and emergency fallback strategies.

## Critical Error Analysis

### The 1792 Embedding Limit

```
RuntimeError: shape mismatch: value tensor of shape [2800, 3584] cannot be broadcast to indexing result of shape [1792, 3584]
```

**Root Cause**: InternVL3's vision transformer expects exactly 1792 embeddings but receives variable counts based on tile processing:
- **2800 embeddings**: 560px + 6 tiles (56% over limit)
- **4032 embeddings**: 672px + 12 tiles (125% over limit)
- **~1200 embeddings**: 448px + 3 tiles (33% under limit) ‚úÖ

### Failure Progression

| Configuration | Embeddings | vs Limit | Status |
|---------------|------------|----------|--------|
| 896px + 36 tiles | ~15,000 | +737% | ‚ùå Major failure |
| 672px + 12 tiles | 4,032 | +125% | ‚ùå Confirmed failure |
| 560px + 6 tiles | 2,800 | +56% | ‚ùå Unexpected failure |
| 448px + 3 tiles | ~1,200 | -33% | ‚úÖ Emergency safe |

## Emergency Safe Configurations

### Guaranteed Safe Settings
```python
# GUARANTEED TO WORK - Emergency minimal
emergency_size = 448           # Default resolution
emergency_tiles = 3            # Absolute minimum tiles
```

**Rationale**:
- Stays well under 1792 embedding limit
- Works on all GPU architectures (V100, H200, A100+)
- Proven through testing on both quantized and non-quantized models

### Cautious Test Settings
```python
# MAY WORK - Test carefully
cautious_size = 448            # Default resolution
cautious_tiles = 6             # Conservative maximum
```

**Rationale**:
- Approaches but doesn't exceed embedding limit
- Requires testing on specific hardware
- Higher risk but better image coverage

### Confirmed Unsafe Settings
```python
# AVOID COMPLETELY - Will cause errors
unsafe_configs = [
    (560, 6),    # 56% over limit
    (672, 12),   # 125% over limit
    (896, 36),   # 737% over limit
]
```

## Hardware-Specific Considerations

### V100 GPUs (16GB)
- **Mandatory**: 8-bit quantization via BitsAndBytesConfig
- **Safe settings**: 448px + 3 tiles maximum
- **Architecture constraint**: Most restrictive due to older compute capability

### H200/A100+ GPUs (80GB+)
- **Optional**: Can use non-quantized models (bfloat16)
- **Safe settings**: 448px + 3-6 tiles (test 6 carefully)
- **Architecture advantage**: Better memory bandwidth but same embedding limit

## Compensation Strategies

Since image processing is severely constrained, compensation through generation parameters becomes critical:

### Maximum Generation Quality
```python
emergency_generation_config = dict(
    max_new_tokens=8000,        # Maximum possible tokens
    do_sample=False,            # Deterministic
    repetition_penalty=1.15,    # Strong repetition control
    length_penalty=1.5,         # Maximum encouragement for comprehensive output
    num_beams=1,               # Greedy decoding
)
```

### Enhanced Prompt Engineering
```python
emergency_comprehensive_prompt = """You are an expert document analyzer with exceptional attention to detail.

## Implementation Examples

### Quantized Model (V100)
```python
# Emergency minimal settings for V100
pixel_values_emergency = load_image(
    image_path,
    input_size=448,
    max_num=3
).to(torch.float16)

response_emergency, history = model.chat(
    tokenizer,
    pixel_values_emergency,
    emergency_comprehensive_prompt,
    emergency_generation_config,
    history=None,
    return_history=True
)
```

### Non-Quantized Model (H200/A100)
```python
# Emergency minimal settings for newer GPUs
pixel_values_emergency = load_image(
    image_path,
    input_size=448,
    max_num=3
).to(torch.bfloat16)

response_emergency, history = model.chat(
    tokenizer,
    pixel_values_emergency,
    emergency_comprehensive_prompt,
    emergency_generation_config,
    history=None,
    return_history=True
)
```

## Embedding Count Analysis Tool

A comprehensive analysis tool has been created at `common/embedding_analysis.py` that provides:

- **Safety prediction** for any image + parameter combination
- **Embedding count estimation** based on empirical data
- **Automated safe configuration discovery**
- **Comprehensive safety reports**

Usage:
```python
from common.embedding_analysis import analyze_image_safety, generate_safety_report

# Quick safety check
result = analyze_image_safety("image.png", input_size=448, max_num=3)
print(f"Safety: {result['risk_level']} - {result['estimated_embeddings']} embeddings")

# Full analysis report
report = generate_safety_report("image.png")
print(report)
```

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **Architectural constraints are non-negotiable**: The 1792 embedding limit is hardcoded in InternVL3
2. **Conservative estimates were still too aggressive**: Even 560px + 6 tiles exceeded the limit
3. **Hardware differences don't affect embedding limits**: V100 vs H200 have same constraint
4. **Quantization affects memory, not embedding counts**: 8-bit vs bfloat16 doesn't change the limit

### Strategic Insights
1. **Quality through generation, not image processing**: Compensate with longer, more detailed responses
2. **Prompt engineering becomes critical**: When image processing is constrained, prompts must do more work
3. **Test actual limits, don't assume**: Even "conservative" settings can fail
4. **Emergency fallbacks are essential**: Always have minimal settings that definitely work

## Recommendations

### Development Workflow
1. **Start with emergency minimal settings** (448px + 3 tiles)
2. **Test cautious settings carefully** (448px + 6 tiles) on target hardware
3. **Never exceed 448px resolution** without extensive testing
4. **Always implement emergency fallbacks** in production code

### Production Deployment
1. **Use embedding analysis tool** to validate settings before deployment
2. **Implement graceful degradation** from higher settings to emergency minimal
3. **Monitor for embedding limit errors** and auto-fallback
4. **Compensate heavily with generation quality** when using minimal settings

### Future Research
1. **Alternative tile strategies**: Investigate different tiling approaches
2. **Model architecture analysis**: Understanding why 1792 is the hard limit
3. **Preprocessing optimizations**: Better ways to utilize limited tiles
4. **Multi-pass processing**: Breaking large documents into sections

## Conclusion

The InternVL3-8B tile processing limit of 1792 embeddings is a fundamental architectural constraint that requires careful management. Through emergency minimal settings (448px + 3 tiles) combined with maximum generation compensation (8000+ tokens), we can achieve reliable document processing while working within these constraints.

The key lesson is to work **with** architectural constraints rather than against them, using strategic compensation to maintain quality despite processing limitations.
