# Celestial Navigation with a Sextant
## 20-Minute Presentation Outline

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Duration:** 30 seconds

### Celestial Navigation with a Sextant
*Finding Your Position Using the Stars*

---

## Slide 2: Why Celestial Navigation?
**Duration:** 1 minute

### Key Points:
- GPS-independent navigation - works when electronics fail
- Required for ocean passages and maritime certification
- Practiced for thousands of years - proven reliability
- Personal seamanship skill and self-reliance
- Still used by military as backup navigation

### Speaker Notes:
"Before GPS, every ship crossing an ocean relied on celestial navigation. Today, it remains a critical backup skill and is still required for many offshore certifications."

---

## Slide 3: What is a Sextant?
**Duration:** 1.5 minutes

### Definition:
A precision optical instrument that measures the angle between two objects - typically a celestial body and the horizon.

### Key Components:
| Part | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Frame/Arc** | Graduated scale (typically 0-120°) |
| **Index Mirror** | Reflects image of celestial body |
| **Horizon Mirror** | Split mirror - see horizon and body simultaneously |
| **Telescope** | Magnifies the view |
| **Drum Micrometer** | Fine angle adjustment (to 0.1 arcminute) |
| **Index Arm** | Moves the index mirror |
| **Shades** | Filters for sun observations |

### Speaker Notes:
"The sextant gets its name from the 60-degree arc (one-sixth of a circle) on early instruments. Modern sextants typically have a 120-degree arc."

### Suggested Image:

## Slide 4: The Principle - Double Reflection
**Duration:** 2 minutes

### How It Works:
1. Light from a celestial body hits the **index mirror**
2. Reflects to the **horizon mirror**
3. Observer sees the body superimposed on the horizon
4. The angle measured = **2× the mirror rotation**

### The Key Insight:
> "The altitude of a celestial body tells you your distance from the point on Earth directly beneath that body."

### Speaker Notes:
"When you measure the sun at 45° altitude, you know you're on a circle approximately 2,700 nautical miles from the sun's geographic position. This is the foundation of celestial navigation."

---

## Slide 5: Celestial Bodies Used
**Duration:** 1.5 minutes

### Primary Bodies:
| Body | When Used | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Sun** | Daytime | Most common, noon sight gives latitude directly |
| **Moon** | Day or night | Requires additional corrections |
| **Venus** | Twilight | Brightest planet, often visible in daylight |
| **57 Navigational Stars** | Night (twilight) | Selected for brightness and distribution |

### Key Navigational Stars (Southern Hemisphere Focus):
1. **Acrux** - Brightest star in Southern Cross, points to pole
2. **Canopus** - Second brightest star in sky, circumpolar in south
3. **Sirius** - Brightest star in sky, visible from both hemispheres
4. **Alpha Centauri** - Pointer star to Southern Cross
5. **Achernar** - End of river Eridanus, helps find south pole
6. **Fomalhaut** - "Lonely star" of southern autumn
7. **Rigel** - Orion's foot, visible worldwide

### Speaker Notes:
"Twilight is the golden hour for celestial navigation - you can see both the horizon and the stars clearly."

---

## Slide 6: The Navigational Triangle (PZX Triangle)
**Duration:** 2 minutes

### The Foundation of Celestial Navigation

The **PZX Triangle** (or Astronomical Triangle) is a spherical triangle on the celestial sphere connecting your position to a celestial body.

### The Three Vertices:

| Point | Name | Definition |
|-------|------|------------|
| **P** | Elevated Pole | South Celestial Pole (for Southern Hemisphere observers) |
| **Z** | Zenith | Point directly above the observer |
| **X** | Celestial Body | Sun, moon, star, or planet being observed |

*Note: The "elevated pole" is whichever celestial pole is above your horizon - South Celestial Pole for Southern Hemisphere, North Celestial Pole for Northern Hemisphere.*

### The Three Sides:

| Side | Name | What It Represents |
|------|------|-------------------|
| **PZ** | Co-Latitude | 90° minus your latitude |
| **PX** | Polar Distance | 90° minus the body's declination |
| **ZX** | Co-Altitude | 90° minus the observed altitude (zenith distance) |

### The Three Angles:

| Angle | Name | Significance |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **At P** | Local Hour Angle (LHA) | How far the body is from your meridian |
| **At Z** | Azimuth | Compass direction to the body |
| **At X** | Parallactic Angle | (Less commonly used) |

### How It Works in Practice:

1. **From the Nautical Almanac:** Declination (PX) and GHA → LHA (angle at P)
2. **From your assumed position:** Your latitude (PZ side)
3. **From the sextant:** Altitude → gives you ZX side
4. **The math solves for:** Calculated altitude (Hc) and Azimuth (Zn)
5. **Compare Hc to observed altitude (Ho):** Difference = Intercept (nautical miles)

### Speaker Notes:
"Think of it as a triangle drawn on a globe connecting three points: the pole, the point directly above you, and the star you're looking at. If we know any three elements, we can solve for the others."

## Slide 7: Essential Tools
**Duration:** 1 minute

### The Navigator's Kit:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Sextant** | Measure altitude of celestial body |
| **Accurate Timepiece** | Time of observation (to the second) |
| **Nautical Almanac** | Daily positions of celestial bodies |
| **Sight Reduction Tables** | Pre-computed solutions (HO-249 or HO-229) |
| **Plotting Sheet** | Chart for drawing position lines |
| **Dividers & Parallel Rules** | Plotting tools |

### Why Time Matters:
- Earth rotates 15° per hour (360° ÷ 24 hours)
- 1 minute of time error = 15 nautical miles of position error
- 4 seconds of time error = 1 nautical mile

### Speaker Notes:
"John Harrison's marine chronometer, invented in 1761, finally solved the longitude problem by keeping accurate time at sea."

---

## Slide 8: Taking a Sight - Setup
**Duration:** 1.5 minutes

### Preparation:
1. **Check index error** - sextant's built-in calibration error
2. **Set approximate altitude** on the arc
3. **Select appropriate shades** (for sun observations)
4. **Note the time** - have a watch ready or an assistant

### Holding the Sextant:
- Hold vertically with right hand on the frame
- Left hand adjusts the drum micrometer
- Brace yourself against the ship's motion
- Keep both eyes open

### The "Rocking" Technique:
- Rotate the sextant slightly left and right
- The body should swing in an arc
- The lowest point of the arc = true altitude
- This ensures the sextant is truly vertical

### Speaker Notes:
"Practice on land first. Find a building of known height, measure its angle, and calculate the distance to verify your technique."

---

## Slide 9: Taking a Sight - Measurement
**Duration:** 1.5 minutes

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Acquire the body** through the telescope
2. **Bring it down** to the horizon using the index arm
3. **Rock the sextant** to find the lowest point
4. **Touch the horizon** - body should just kiss the horizon line
5. **Call "MARK!"** at the exact moment
6. **Record the time** (to the second)
7. **Read the angle** from the arc and drum

### What You Record:
```
Date: 15 Jan 2024
Body: Sun (Lower Limb)
Time (UTC): 02:32:47
Sextant Altitude (Hs): 58° 15.3'
Index Error: +2.0' (on the arc)
Height of Eye: 3 meters
Position: Southern Indian Ocean
```

### Speaker Notes:
"Lower limb means you brought the bottom edge of the sun to the horizon. This is standard practice because it's easier to judge than the center."

---

## Slide 10: Corrections
**Duration:** 2 minutes

### From Sextant Altitude (Hs) to Observed Altitude (Ho):

| Correction | Reason | Typical Value |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| **Index Error** | Sextant calibration | ±0-5' |
| **Dip** | Height of eye above water | -3' per 3m height |
| **Refraction** | Atmosphere bends light | -1' to -34' |
| **Semi-diameter** | Sun/Moon radius | ±16' (sun) |
| **Parallax** | Moon only | Up to 61' |

### The Correction Formula:
```
Ho = Hs ± Index Error - Dip - Refraction ± Semi-diameter
```

### Example:
```
Sextant Altitude (Hs):     42° 15.3'
Index Error (+2.0' on):    -  2.0'
Dip (3m height):           -  3.0'
Refraction:                -  1.1'
Semi-diameter (lower limb):+ 16.0'
                           ─────────
Observed Altitude (Ho):    42° 25.2'
```

### Speaker Notes:
"The Nautical Almanac includes correction tables that combine these into a single 'altitude correction' for simplicity."

---

## Slide 11: The Noon Sight
**Duration:** 2 minutes

### The Simplest Celestial Observation

When the sun crosses your meridian (local apparent noon):
- The sun is at its highest point
- The PZX triangle collapses to a straight line
- **Latitude can be calculated directly** - no sight reduction tables needed!

### The Formula:
```
Latitude = 90° - Altitude + Declination (same name)
Latitude = 90° - Altitude - Declination (contrary name)
```
*"Same name" = both North or both South*

### Procedure:
1. Start observing ~15 minutes before estimated noon
2. Track the sun as it rises
3. Note when it stops rising and begins to fall
4. Record the **maximum altitude**
5. Note the **exact time** (this gives you longitude approximation)

### Example (Southern Hemisphere):
```
Maximum Altitude (Ho): 72° 15'
Sun's Declination:     S 15° 30' (from Almanac - summer in south)
Observer in Southern Hemisphere (same name - both South)

Latitude = 90° - 72° 15' + 15° 30'
Latitude = 17° 45' + 15° 30'
Latitude = 33° 15' S
```

*Note: "Same name" means latitude and declination are both South (or both North). "Contrary name" means they are opposite.*

### Speaker Notes:
"The noon sight has been used for centuries. It's reliable, straightforward, and gives you a confirmed latitude with minimal calculation."

---

## Slide 12: Plotting a Line of Position (LOP)
**Duration:** 2 minutes

### The Intercept Method (Marcq St. Hilaire Method)

#### Step 1: Start with an Assumed Position (AP)
- Use your dead reckoning position
- Round latitude to whole degrees for easier table lookup

#### Step 2: Calculate What You *Should* See
- Use sight reduction tables (HO-249 or HO-229)
- Enter with: Assumed Latitude, Declination, Local Hour Angle
- Get: Calculated Altitude (Hc) and Azimuth (Zn)

#### Step 3: Compare to What You *Actually* Saw
```
Intercept = Ho - Hc
```
- **Ho > Hc:** You're closer to the body → "Toward"
- **Ho < Hc:** You're farther from the body → "Away"

#### Step 4: Plot the Line
1. From your AP, draw a line toward the body (azimuth direction)
2. Mark the intercept distance (1' = 1 nautical mile)
3. Draw a perpendicular line through that point
4. **This is your Line of Position**

### The Rule:
> **"Computed Greater Away"** (CGA) - if Hc > Ho, plot away from the body

### Speaker Notes:
"You're not ON this line exactly - you're somewhere along it. You need at least two lines to get a fix."

---

## Slide 13: The Fix
**Duration:** 1 minute

### Where Two or More Lines Cross

| Fix Type | Method | Best Practice |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Running Fix** | Two sun sights, hours apart | Advance first LOP for distance traveled |
| **Star Fix** | 3+ stars at twilight | Ideal: 3 stars, 120° apart |
| **Sun-Moon Fix** | Daytime | When moon is visible |

### The Cocked Hat:
- Three LOPs rarely intersect at a single point
- They form a small triangle called the "cocked hat"
- Your position is assumed to be inside this triangle
- Smaller triangle = more accurate fix

### Accuracy:
- Good sextant work: ±1-2 nautical miles
- Excellent conditions: ±0.5 nautical miles
- Compare to GPS: ±10 meters

### Speaker Notes:
"A 2-mile accuracy might seem rough compared to GPS, but it's remarkable given you're measuring angles to stars millions of miles away with a handheld instrument."

---

## Slide 14: Finding South - The Southern Cross
**Duration:** 1.5 minutes

### Navigation Without Polaris

Unlike the Northern Hemisphere, there's no bright star at the South Celestial Pole. Instead, navigators use the **Southern Cross (Crux)** constellation.

### Method 1: The 4.5× Extension (Simplest)
1. Identify the Southern Cross (Gacrux at top, Acrux at bottom)
2. Draw an imaginary line from Gacrux through Acrux
3. Extend this line **4.5 times** the length of the Cross
4. This point is the South Celestial Pole
5. Drop straight down to the horizon = **Due South**

### Method 2: Using the Pointer Stars (More Accurate)
1. Draw Line 1 through the long axis of the Cross
2. Find Alpha and Beta Centauri (the "Pointers")
3. Draw Line 2 connecting the Pointers
4. Find the midpoint of Line 2
5. Draw Line 3 perpendicular from this midpoint
6. Where Lines 1 and 3 intersect = South Celestial Pole

### Avoiding the False Cross:
- The False Cross (in Carina/Vela) looks similar but is larger and dimmer
- It does NOT point to the South Celestial Pole
- The true Southern Cross has a 5th star (Epsilon Crucis) inside it

- [Constellation Guide](https://www.constellation-guide.com/the-southern-cross/)

### Speaker Notes:
"Polynesian navigators crossed thousands of miles of Pacific Ocean using the Southern Cross and other stars centuries before Europeans had reliable celestial navigation."

---

## Slide 15: Practical Demonstration
**Duration:** 1.5 minutes

### Walk-Through Example: Noon Sight

**Scenario:** You're sailing in the Southern Indian Ocean, DR position approximately 35°S, 80°E (between Australia and South Africa)

**Observation:**
- Date: March 21 (Equinox - sun on celestial equator)
- Maximum sun altitude: 55° 00' (sun bears North at noon)
- Sun's declination: 0° (equinox)

**Calculation:**
```
Latitude = 90° - Ho ± Declination
Latitude = 90° - 55° 00' ± 0°
Latitude = 35° 00' S
```

**Result:** Your latitude is 35° South - confirmed!

*Note: In the Southern Hemisphere at noon, the sun bears North (not South as in the Northern Hemisphere).*

### Speaker Notes:
"The equinox is the easiest day to demonstrate because the sun's declination is zero. Notice that from the Southern Hemisphere, we face North to observe the noon sun."

# Appendix A: Calculating Longitude - Complete Worked Example

## The Longitude Problem

Unlike latitude (which can be found directly from a noon sight), **longitude requires accurate time**. This was the great challenge of navigation for centuries - solved only when John Harrison invented the marine chronometer in 1761.

### The Key Relationship:

> **Longitude = GHA of body - LHA of body**
>
> Or equivalently:
> **LHA = GHA ± Longitude** (+ for West, - for East)

Where:
- **GHA** (Greenwich Hour Angle) = angle of body west of Greenwich meridian (from Almanac)
- **LHA** (Local Hour Angle) = angle of body west of observer's meridian
- **Longitude** = the difference between these two

---

## Understanding Hour Angles

### Greenwich Hour Angle (GHA)
- Measured **westward** from Greenwich (0° to 360°)
- Found in the Nautical Almanac for the exact time of observation
- Changes continuously as Earth rotates (15° per hour for stars, ~15° for sun)

### Local Hour Angle (LHA)
- Measured **westward** from the observer's meridian (0° to 360°)
- This is what we need for sight reduction tables
- Calculated from: **LHA = GHA - West Longitude** or **LHA = GHA + East Longitude**

### The Critical Insight:
If you know the GHA (from the Almanac + accurate time) and can determine the LHA (from the sight reduction), the difference gives you longitude!

---

## Complete Worked Example: Sun Sight for Longitude

### Scenario

You're sailing in the Southern Indian Ocean, en route from Fremantle, Australia to Mauritius.
- **Date:** January 15, 2024 (summer in Southern Hemisphere)
- **DR Position:** 32° 00' S, 85° 00' E (your best estimate)
- **Time of observation (UTC):** 06:42:35 (early afternoon local time)
- **Body observed:** Sun (lower limb)
- **Sextant altitude (Hs):** 68° 23.5' (sun high in summer)
- **Index error:** 1.5' off the arc (add)
- **Height of eye:** 3 meters

### Step 1: Apply Corrections to Get Observed Altitude (Ho)

```
Sextant Altitude (Hs):          68° 23.5'
Index Correction (+1.5' off):   +    1.5'
                                ──────────
Apparent Altitude:              68° 25.0'

Dip (3m height of eye):         -    3.0'
                                ──────────
                                68° 22.0'

Altitude Correction (sun, LL):  +   15.6'   (from Nautical Almanac tables)
                                ──────────
Observed Altitude (Ho):         68° 37.6'
```

### Step 2: Extract Data from the Nautical Almanac

**For January 15, 2024 at 06:00 UTC:**

| Data | Value | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| GHA Sun (06:00) | 268° 52.3' | Daily pages |
| Declination (06:00) | S 21° 08.4' | Daily pages (sun in south = summer) |
| d correction | +0.4' | Daily pages |
| GHA increment (42m 35s) | 10° 38.8' | Increments table |

**Calculate GHA at observation time:**
```
GHA (06:00 UTC):        268° 52.3'
Increment (42m 35s):    + 10° 38.8'
                        ───────────
GHA Sun (06:42:35):     279° 31.1'
```

**Calculate Declination at observation time:**
```
Declination (06:00):    S 21° 08.4'
d correction (42.6m):   +     0.3'    (d = +0.4' × 42.6/60)
                        ───────────
Declination:            S 21° 08.7'
```

*Note: In January, the sun's declination is South (summer in Southern Hemisphere), which is "same name" as our Southern Hemisphere position.*

### Step 3: Set Up for Sight Reduction

**Choose an Assumed Position (AP):**
- Assumed Latitude: **32° S** (round to whole degree)
- Assumed Longitude: **84° 31.1' E** (chosen so LHA comes out to whole degree)

**Calculate Local Hour Angle (LHA):**
```
GHA:                    279° 31.1'
Assumed Longitude (E):  + 84° 31.1'   (ADD for East longitude)
                        ───────────
                        364° 02.2'

Since result > 360°, subtract 360°:
LHA:                      4° 00.0'
```

*Note: For Eastern longitudes, ADD the longitude to GHA. For Western longitudes, SUBTRACT.*

### Step 4: Enter Sight Reduction Tables (HO-249 Vol. 2)

**Entering arguments:**
- Assumed Latitude: 32° S
- Declination: 21° (same name as latitude - both South)
- LHA: 4°

**From HO-249 tables:**
```
Tabulated Hc:           68° 42'
d value:                +18
Z value:                173°
```

**Interpolate for actual declination (21° 08.7'):**
```
Declination correction: 8.7' × 18/60 = +2.6' ≈ +3'

Calculated Altitude (Hc): 68° 42' + 3' = 68° 45'
```

**Convert Z to Azimuth (Zn):**
- Rule for Southern Hemisphere, LHA < 180°: Zn = 180° - Z
- Zn = 180° - 173° = **007°** (nearly due North)

*Note: In January from 32°S, the afternoon sun is high and bears slightly west of north.*

### Step 5: Calculate the Intercept

```
Observed Altitude (Ho):     68° 37.6'
Calculated Altitude (Hc):   68° 45.0'
                            ──────────
Intercept (Ho - Hc):        -7.4' = 7.4 nautical miles AWAY
```

**Interpretation:** Ho < Hc, so we're **7.4 nm farther from the sun** than the assumed position.

### Step 6: Plot the Line of Position

1. **Plot the Assumed Position (AP):** 32° 00' S, 84° 31.1' E
2. **Draw azimuth line:** From AP toward 007° (direction to sun - nearly due North)
3. **Mark intercept:** 7.4 nm AWAY from sun (opposite direction, toward 187°)
4. **Draw LOP:** Perpendicular to azimuth through the intercept point

### Step 7: Determine Longitude

The Line of Position runs roughly E-W (perpendicular to azimuth 007°).

**From plotting or calculation:**

Your position lies somewhere along this line. Combined with your latitude from a noon sight or other observation:

```
If Latitude (from noon sight):  32° 15' S
Reading from the LOP:           Longitude ≈ 84° 45' E
```

*Note: When the sun is nearly due north (as it is from the Southern Hemisphere in summer), the LOP runs nearly east-west, which is excellent for determining longitude.*

---

## The Direct Time-Sight Method (Alternative)

For a quicker longitude estimate when the sun is near the prime vertical (bearing ~090° or ~270°):

### Formula:
```
cos(LHA) = [sin(Ho) - sin(Lat) × sin(Dec)] / [cos(Lat) × cos(Dec)]
```

Then:
```
Longitude = GHA - LHA  (if LHA < 180°, afternoon)
Longitude = GHA - (360° - LHA)  (if LHA > 180°, morning)
```

### Using Our Example Values:
```
Ho = 68° 37.6' = 68.63°
Lat = 32° 15' S = -32.25° (negative for calculation)
Dec = 21° 08.7' S = -21.145° (negative for calculation)

cos(LHA) = [sin(68.63°) - sin(-32.25°) × sin(-21.145°)] / [cos(-32.25°) × cos(-21.145°)]
cos(LHA) = [0.9304 - (-0.5334) × (-0.3607)] / [0.8462 × 0.9327]
cos(LHA) = [0.9304 - 0.1924] / [0.7893]
cos(LHA) = 0.7380 / 0.7893
cos(LHA) = 0.9350

LHA = arccos(0.9350) = 20.8°
```

Since observation was in the afternoon (sun west of meridian in Southern Hemisphere), LHA is small and positive.

For eastern longitudes:
```
Longitude (East) = LHA - GHA + 360° (if result < 0)
Longitude = 4° - 279.5° + 360°
Longitude = 84.5° E ✓
```

**Result: Longitude ≈ 84° 30' E** (close to our assumed position in the Southern Indian Ocean!)

## Summary: The Longitude Calculation Process (Southern Hemisphere Example)

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Record exact UTC time | 06:42:35 |
| 2 | Correct sextant altitude | Ho = 68° 37.6' |
| 3 | Get GHA from Almanac | GHA = 279° 31.1' |
| 4 | Calculate LHA (add for East longitude) | LHA = 4° |
| 5 | Use sight reduction for Hc and Zn | Hc = 68° 45', Zn = 007° |
| 6 | Calculate intercept | 7.4 nm Away |
| 7 | Plot LOP | Line through intercept, perpendicular to Zn |
| 8 | Combine with latitude LOP | **Fix gives longitude ≈ 84° 45' E** |

## Why Accurate Time is Critical

| Time Error | Position Error (at equator) |
|------------|----------------------------|
| 1 second | 0.25 nautical miles |
| 4 seconds | 1 nautical mile |
| 1 minute | 15 nautical miles |
| 4 minutes | 60 nautical miles (1 degree) |

> *"The longitude problem was really a time problem. Once you can keep accurate time at sea, longitude becomes a matter of simple arithmetic."*

---

## Quick Reference: Longitude Formulas

### For Western Longitudes:
```
LHA = GHA - Longitude(W)
If result < 0°, add 360°

Longitude(W) = GHA - LHA
If result < 0°, add 360°
```

### For Eastern Longitudes:
```
LHA = GHA + Longitude(E)
If result > 360°, subtract 360°

Longitude(E) = LHA - GHA
If result < 0°, add 360°
```

### The Universal Rule:
```
LHA = GHA ± Longitude
(+ for East, - for West)

Always adjust to keep LHA between 0° and 360°
```

# Appendix B: Latitude by the Sun's Path Angle

## The Principle

The sun's daily path across the sky (its **diurnal arc**) is always parallel to the celestial equator. The angle this path makes with the horizon is directly related to the observer's latitude.

### The Key Relationship:

```
Angle of sun's path with horizon = 90° - |Latitude|
```

Or, solving for latitude:

```
Latitude = 90° - (angle of sun's path with horizon)
```

This works because the celestial equator meets the horizon at an angle equal to the **co-latitude** (90° minus latitude).

## Methods to Measure the Sun's Path Angle

### Method 1: Two-Sight Plotting

1. Take a sun sight at sunrise (or morning)
2. Take another sight 1-2 hours later
3. Plot both positions on a chart
4. Draw a line connecting them - this is the sun's track
5. Measure the angle between this line and the horizon (east-west line)

**Example:**
```
First sight:  Altitude 15°, Azimuth 095°
Second sight: Altitude 35°, Azimuth 120°

Plot both positions relative to assumed position.
Connect with a line.
Measure angle of line from horizontal = Sun's path angle
```

### Method 2: Shadow Stick (Gnomon) Method

This ancient technique requires no instruments:

1. Place a vertical stick (gnomon) on flat ground
2. Mark the tip of the shadow at regular intervals (every 15-30 minutes)
3. Connect the shadow tip marks - they form a line
4. This line represents the sun's path projected onto the ground
5. The angle of this line from the east-west axis equals the sun's path angle

```
        N
        |
        |     × 10:00
        |   × 10:30        ← Shadow tips trace
        | × 11:00              the sun's path
   W ───┼─×─11:30──────── E
        | × 12:00
        |   × 12:30
        |     × 13:00
        |
        S

        Stick (gnomon) at center
```

**Note:** On the equinoxes, this line runs exactly east-west. On other dates, it curves slightly.

### Method 3: Direct Observation at Sunrise/Sunset

1. Watch the sun as it rises or sets
2. Note the angle of its path relative to the horizon
3. Use a simple inclinometer or protractor aligned with the horizon
4. Estimate the angle of the sun's trajectory

**Best conditions:**
- Clear horizon (at sea)
- Sunrise or sunset (path angle most visible)
- Lower latitudes (steeper angle, easier to measure)

---

## Worked Example

### Scenario:
You're shipwrecked on an unknown island in the Southern Ocean with no instruments except a protractor. By observing the sunrise, you estimate the sun's path makes a **55° angle** with the horizon. At noon, you notice the sun is to your **North**.

### Calculation:
```
Latitude = 90° - Sun's path angle
Latitude = 90° - 55°
Latitude = 35°
```

### Result:
You're at approximately **35° South latitude**.

*How do you know it's South? The sun bore North at noon, which only happens in the Southern Hemisphere (or in the tropics when the sun's declination is greater than your latitude).*

---

## Seasonal Correction

The basic formula assumes the celestial equator. For greater accuracy, account for the sun's declination:

### At Equinoxes (March 21, September 23):
- Sun is on celestial equator
- Formula works exactly: **Latitude = 90° - path angle**

### At Solstices and Other Dates:
The sun's path is offset from the celestial equator by its declination. The path angle still equals 90° - latitude, but the sun's **noon altitude** changes.

For the path angle method, the declination doesn't significantly affect the angle of the path - only where along that path the sun travels.

---

## The Amplitude Method (Related Technique)

The **Amplitude** is the bearing of the sun when it's exactly on the celestial horizon (rising or setting). This is related to the path angle method.

### Formula:
```
sin(Amplitude) = sin(Declination) / cos(Latitude)
```

Or solving for latitude:
```
cos(Latitude) = sin(Declination) / sin(Amplitude)
```

### What is Amplitude?
- The angular distance of the sun from the **east point** (at sunrise) or **west point** (at sunset)
- Measured along the horizon
- Named N or S depending on the sun's declination

### Example (Southern Hemisphere):
```
Date: January 15 (summer in Southern Hemisphere)
Sun's Declination: S 21.5°
Observed Amplitude: Sun rose at bearing 115° (25° south of east)

sin(25°) = sin(21.5°) / cos(Latitude)
cos(Latitude) = sin(21.5°) / sin(25°)
cos(Latitude) = 0.366 / 0.423
cos(Latitude) = 0.866
Latitude = arccos(0.866) = 30°
```

**Result:** Latitude is approximately **30° S**

*How do you know it's South? The sun rose south of east, and its declination is South (summer in Southern Hemisphere). In the Southern Hemisphere during summer, the sun rises and sets south of the east-west line.*

### Amplitude Table (Quick Reference)

For a body with declination = 20°:

| Latitude | Amplitude |
|----------|-----------|
| 0° | 20.0° |
| 10° | 20.3° |
| 20° | 21.3° |
| 30° | 23.1° |
| 40° | 26.1° |
| 50° | 31.1° |
| 60° | 40.0° |

## Practical Considerations

### Advantages:
- No sextant required (for shadow stick method)
- No accurate time required
- Works with simple observation
- Good emergency/survival technique

### Limitations:
- Less precise than sextant methods (typically ±2-5° accuracy)
- Requires clear view of horizon
- Better accuracy at lower latitudes
- Sunrise/sunset observation only
- Weather dependent

### Best Uses:
- Survival situations without instruments
- Cross-check against sextant observations
- Teaching the fundamentals of celestial navigation
- Historical/traditional navigation appreciation

---

## Historical Note

This method predates the sextant by millennia. **Polynesian navigators** used the angle of star paths (including the sun) to maintain latitude during long ocean voyages across the South Pacific. They memorized the rising and setting angles of key stars at different islands, allowing them to sail along "star paths" to their destinations.

The **Southern Cross** was particularly important - its angle above the horizon changes predictably with latitude, and its orientation helps find south. Pacific Islanders navigating between Hawaii, New Zealand, and Easter Island relied on these techniques for thousands of years.

> *"The Polynesians didn't just observe the stars - they understood their geometry. The angle of a star's rise told them their latitude as surely as any instrument. The Southern Cross was their compass, the sun's path their map."*
