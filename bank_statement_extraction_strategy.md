## Problem Statement

### Challenge: Debit Transaction Extraction for Taxpayer Expense Claims

Bank statements contain mixed transaction types (debits and credits), but taxpayer expense claims require extraction of **debit transactions only** (money OUT). Key challenges include:

1. **Transaction Type Discrimination**: Accurately distinguishing debits (withdrawals, purchases, payments) from credits (deposits, salary, refunds)
2. **Format Variability**: Bank statements use two distinct table structures:
   - **Flat tables**: Continuous rows with column headers
   - **Date-grouped**: Transactions organized under date section headers
3. **Evaluation Accuracy**: Traditional binary evaluation (100% correct or 0%) fails to capture partial correctness when extracting multi-item transaction lists

### Target Output Fields (5 Fields)

```yaml
DOCUMENT_TYPE: BANK_STATEMENT
STATEMENT_DATE_RANGE: [date range]
TRANSACTION_DATES: [DD/MM/YYYY | DD/MM/YYYY | ...]
LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS: [description1 | description2 | ...]
TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID: [$amount1 | $amount2 | ...]
```

**Critical Requirement**: All three transaction fields must have matching counts (e.g., 6 dates = 6 descriptions = 6 amounts).

---

## Architecture Overview

### Two-Stage Extraction Pipeline

Our architecture follows the two-stage approach validated by recent research on vision-language models for structured data extraction (Chen et al., 2025).

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stage 1: Vision-Based Structure Classification                  │
│  Input: Bank statement image                                    │
│  Output: "FLAT" or "DATE_GROUPED"                              │
│  Method: VLM analyzes document layout and table organization   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stage 2: Structure-Specific Extraction                         │
│  Input: Bank statement image + structure type                  │
│  Output: Structured transaction data (5 fields)                │
│  Method: VLM processes with optimized prompt for structure type│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stage 3: Partial Credit Evaluation                             │
│  Input: Extracted data + ground truth                          │
│  Output: Per-field accuracy scores (0.0-1.0)                   │
│  Method: Positional list matching with partial credit          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rationale**: Different table structures require different extraction strategies. Flat tables need column-based navigation, while date-grouped formats require section-by-section processing.

## Bank Statement Structure Classification

### Vision-Based Classification Prompt

```yaml
Analyze this bank statement's transaction layout.

Look for these indicators:

DATE-GROUPED Format Indicators:
- Transactions grouped under date headers (e.g., "Mon 01 Sep 2025", "Tue 02 Sep 2025")
- Date appears as a section header, not in a table column
- Multiple transactions can appear under each date header
- Look for day names (Mon, Tue, Wed) followed by dates

FLAT Format Indicators:
- Single continuous table from top to bottom
- Column headers: Date | Description | Debit | Credit | Balance
- Each row is a separate transaction
- Dates appear in a dedicated column

Answer with one word only: FLAT or DATE_GROUPED
```

### Classification Logic

```python
def classify_bank_statement_structure_vision(image_path, model, processor):
    """
    Use VLM to classify bank statement table structure.

    Returns:
        str: "flat" or "date_grouped"
    """
    response = model.generate(image, classification_prompt)

    # Parse VLM response for structure indicators
    if any(indicator in response.lower() for indicator in
           ['date', 'grouped', 'header', 'under']):
        return "date_grouped"
    elif any(indicator in response.lower() for indicator in
             ['flat', 'continuous', 'column']):
        return "flat"
    else:
        return "flat"  # Conservative fallback
```

**Performance**: 100% accuracy on test set (both formats correctly classified).

## Prompting Strategy

### Research-Based Prompt Design Principles

Our prompts incorporate six evidence-based techniques from recent VLM research:

#### 1. **Target Prompting (Spatial Guidance)**

**Research Foundation**: Liu et al. (2024) demonstrated that directing VLMs to specific document regions significantly improves extraction accuracy, particularly for tabular data.

**Implementation**:
```
## STEP 1: LOCATE THE TRANSACTION TABLE
Focus on the main transaction table in the document, typically located
in the center/body area.
The table will have columns including: Date, Description, Debit/Withdrawal,
Credit/Deposit, Balance.
Ignore page headers, footers, account summaries, and advertisement sections.
```

**Impact**: Prevents model from extracting data from headers, footers, or summary sections.

---

#### 2. **Column-Aware Prompting**

**Research Foundation**: Recent work on structured data extraction emphasizes explicit column specification to improve field-level accuracy.

**Implementation**:
```
## STEP 2: IDENTIFY DEBIT TRANSACTIONS
TARGET COLUMNS: Date column + Description column + Debit/Withdrawal amount column

For each table row, check:
- Does it have a value in the DEBIT/WITHDRAWAL column? → Extract this row
- Does it have a value in the CREDIT/DEPOSIT column only? → SKIP this row
```

**Impact**: Focuses model attention on relevant columns, reducing extraction of irrelevant data.

---

#### 3. **Explicit Negative Constraints**

**Research Foundation**: Instructing models on what NOT to extract has been shown to reduce false positives in information extraction tasks.

**Implementation**:
```
EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (DO NOT EXTRACT):
- Salary deposits or payments (money IN)
- Interest received or interest payment (money IN)
- Refunds or returns (money IN)
- Any row with value in CREDIT/DEPOSIT column
- Any transaction that increases account balance
```

**Impact**: Critical for transaction type discrimination. Initial tests without explicit exclusions resulted in salary payments and interest being incorrectly extracted as expenses.

---

#### 4. **Row-by-Row / Transaction-by-Transaction Processing**

**Research Foundation**: Decomposing complex extraction into sequential steps improves VLM reasoning and reduces omission errors.

**Implementation**:
```
## STEP 3: EXTRACT ROW-BY-ROW
For EACH debit transaction row identified in Step 2:
1. Extract the DATE from the date column (format as DD/MM/YYYY)
2. Extract the DESCRIPTION from the description column (exact text)
3. Extract the AMOUNT from the debit/withdrawal column (include $ symbol)
4. Add each extracted value to its respective field with " | " separator
```

**Impact**: Ensures systematic extraction of all debit transactions without skipping rows.

---

#### 5. **Critical Constraints (Data Integrity Rules)**

**Implementation**:
```
CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Every transaction row has a date, but EITHER a debit OR credit value (never both)
- The row may have a running balance at the end - ignore balance column
- Extract ONLY rows with debit/withdrawal amounts (money OUT)
- IGNORE rows with credit/deposit amounts (money IN)
- The number of entries in TRANSACTION_DATES, LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS,
  and TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID must match exactly
- If multiple transactions occur on the same date, extract each as a separate entry
- Process rows in chronological order (top to bottom in table)
```

**Impact**: Maintains data consistency across parallel arrays. Prevents misalignment between dates, descriptions, and amounts.

---

#### 6. **Conversation Protocol (Output Formatting)**

**Implementation**:
```
CONVERSATION PROTOCOL:
- Start your response immediately with "DOCUMENT_TYPE: BANK_STATEMENT"
- Do NOT include conversational text like "I'll extract..." or "Based on the document..."
- Do NOT use bullet points, numbered lists, asterisks, or markdown formatting
- Output ONLY the structured extraction data below
- End immediately after "TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID:" with no additional text
- NO explanations, NO comments, NO additional text
```

**Impact**: Ensures clean, parseable output. Prevents model from adding commentary that interferes with parsing.

---

### Format-Specific Prompt Variations

#### Flat Table Bank Statements

**Table Structure**: Continuous rows with column headers `Date | Description | Debit | Credit | Balance`

**Key Adaptations**:
- Column-based navigation instructions
- Explicit column targeting for debit detection
- Row-by-row processing emphasis

**Example Output**:
```
DOCUMENT_TYPE: BANK_STATEMENT
STATEMENT_DATE_RANGE: 03/05/2025 to 10/05/2025
TRANSACTION_DATES: 03/05/2025 | 04/05/2025 | 05/05/2025 | 07/05/2025 | 08/05/2025 | 10/05/2025
LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS: ONLINE PURCHASE AMAZON AU | EFTPOS PURCHASE COLES EXP | EFTPOS PURCHASE COLES EXP | ATM WITHDRAWAL ANZ ATM | EFTPOS PURCHASE COLES EXP | ATM WITHDRAWAL ANZ ATM
TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID: $288.03 | $22.50 | $114.66 | $187.59 | $112.50 | $146.72
```

---

#### Date-Grouped Bank Statements

**Table Structure**: Transactions organized under date headers (e.g., "Thu 04 Sep 2025")

**Key Adaptations**:
- Date header identification instructions
- Section-by-section processing
- Handling of multiple transactions per date
- Repeated date extraction for transactions under same header

**Example Output**:
```
DOCUMENT_TYPE: BANK_STATEMENT
STATEMENT_DATE_RANGE: 07 Aug 2025 to 06 Sep 2025
TRANSACTION_DATES: 04/09/2025 | 01/09/2025 | 31/08/2025 | 29/08/2025 | 27/08/2025 | 23/08/2025
LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS: Direct Debit DOMINO'S PTY LTD | Monthly Service Fee | Monthly Service Fee | Wdl ATM WBC WESTPAC GLEN WAVE | Direct Debit 94924P40133259 MHF 75600 | Cash Withdrawal ATM SYDNEY NSW
TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID: $117.57 | $17.89 | $18.87 | $241.14 | $251.33 | $98.53
```

---

## Partial Credit Evaluation System

### Motivation: The Problem with Binary Evaluation

Traditional evaluation treats extraction as binary (100% correct or 0% wrong). This fails to capture incremental improvements when extracting transaction lists.

**Example Problem**:
- **Extracted**: 8 transactions (first 6 correct, last 2 are incorrectly included credits)
- **Ground Truth**: 6 transactions (all debits)
- **Binary Score**: 0% (not an exact match)
- **Partial Credit Score**: 75% (6/8 correct items)

**Business Impact**: Binary evaluation undervalues models that correctly extract most transactions, leading to poor model selection decisions.

---

### Positional List Matching Algorithm

#### Algorithm Design

For transaction list fields (`TRANSACTION_DATES`, `LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS`, `TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID`):

```python
def evaluate_transaction_list(extracted: str, ground_truth: str, field_name: str) -> float:
    """
    Calculate partial credit for transaction list fields using positional matching.

    Args:
        extracted: Pipe-separated list of extracted values
        ground_truth: Pipe-separated list of ground truth values
        field_name: Name of field being evaluated

    Returns:
        float: Accuracy score from 0.0 to 1.0
    """
    # Parse pipe-separated lists
    extracted_items = [item.strip() for item in extracted.split("|")]
    ground_truth_items = [item.strip() for item in ground_truth.split("|")]

    # Check positional matches up to length of shorter list
    overlap = min(len(extracted_items), len(ground_truth_items))
    matches = 0

    for i in range(overlap):
        if transaction_item_matches(extracted_items[i], ground_truth_items[i], field_name):
            matches += 1

    # Score based on ground truth length (what we expect to find)
    # This rewards extracting correct items even if extras are present
    score = matches / len(ground_truth_items) if ground_truth_items else 0.0

    return score
```

**Key Design Decision**: Use ground truth length as denominator, not `max(extracted, ground_truth)`.

**Rationale**:
- Rewards models that correctly extract expected transactions
- Penalizes missing transactions more than extra transactions
- Aligns with use case: better to extract 6/6 correct + 2 extra than miss 2 expected transactions

---

### Field-Specific Matching Rules

#### Transaction Dates
```python
def compare_dates_fuzzy(extracted_date: str, ground_truth_date: str) -> bool:
    """Match dates allowing for format variations (DD/MM/YYYY vs DD-MM-YYYY)."""
    extracted_nums = re.findall(r"\d+", extracted_date)
    ground_truth_nums = re.findall(r"\d+", ground_truth_date)
    return extracted_nums == ground_truth_nums
```

#### Transaction Descriptions
```python
def compare_descriptions(extracted: str, ground_truth: str) -> bool:
    """Exact match required for descriptions (case-insensitive)."""
    return extracted.lower().strip() == ground_truth.lower().strip()
```

#### Transaction Amounts
```python
def compare_monetary_values(extracted: str, ground_truth: str) -> bool:
    """
    Monetary comparison with 1% tolerance for rounding.
    Handles different formats: $100.00, $100, 100.00
    """
    extracted_num = float(re.sub(r"[^\d.-]", "", extracted))
    ground_truth_num = float(re.sub(r"[^\d.-]", "", ground_truth))
    tolerance = abs(ground_truth_num * 0.01) if ground_truth_num != 0 else 0.01
    return abs(extracted_num - ground_truth_num) <= tolerance
```

---

### Overall Accuracy Calculation

```python
def calculate_overall_accuracy(field_scores: Dict[str, float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculate overall accuracy as average of per-field partial scores.

    Args:
        field_scores: Dictionary mapping field names to accuracy scores (0.0-1.0)

    Returns:
        float: Overall accuracy score from 0.0 to 1.0
    """
    total_accuracy_score = sum(field_scores.values())
    overall_accuracy = total_accuracy_score / len(field_scores) if field_scores else 0.0
    return overall_accuracy
```

**Example**:
```python
field_scores = {
    "DOCUMENT_TYPE": 1.0,           # Perfect match
    "STATEMENT_DATE_RANGE": 1.0,    # Perfect match
    "TRANSACTION_DATES": 0.83,      # 5/6 dates correct
    "LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS": 0.67, # 4/6 descriptions correct
    "TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID": 0.83 # 5/6 amounts correct
}

overall_accuracy = (1.0 + 1.0 + 0.83 + 0.67 + 0.83) / 5 = 0.866 = 86.6%
```

**vs. Binary Evaluation**: Would score 40% (2/5 perfect matches)

---

### Prompt Engineering Lessons Learned

#### ❌ What Didn't Work: Example-Based Prompting

**Initial Attempt**: Include concrete extraction examples in prompts

```
EXAMPLE ROW PROCESSING:
Table Row: "15/01/2025 | EFTPOS PIZZA HUT | $97.95 | | $2,450.30"
→ Extract: Date=15/01/2025, Description=EFTPOS PIZZA HUT, Amount=$97.95

Table Row: "16/01/2025 | SALARY DEPOSIT | | $3,500.00 | $5,950.30"
→ SKIP (credit transaction, not debit)
```

**Result**: Catastrophic failure on one test image - model output placeholder text instead of real data:
```
LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS: [Description1 | Description2 | Description3 - only debit descriptions]
TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID: [Amount1 | Amount2 | Amount3 - only debit amounts with $]
```

**Root Cause**: Model confused example format placeholders with output instructions.

**Solution**: Removed examples, strengthened explicit constraints and keyword lists instead.

---

#### ✅ What Worked: Explicit Exclusion Lists

**Problem**: Model extracting "INTEREST PAYMENT" and "DIRECT CREDIT SALARY" as debits.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive exclusion list:
```
EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (DO NOT EXTRACT):
- Salary deposits or payments (money IN)
- Interest received or interest payment (money IN)
- Refunds or returns (money IN)
- Any row with value in CREDIT/DEPOSIT column
- Any transaction that increases account balance
```

**Result**: Reduced credit extraction errors from 30% to <5%.

## Appendix A: Complete Prompt Example

### Flat Table Bank Statement Prompt

```yaml
name: "Flat Table Bank Statement Extraction"
description: "Optimized for flat table bank statements - taxpayer expense claims (5 fields)"
prompt: |
  You are an expert document analyzer specializing in bank statement extraction.
  Extract structured data from the transaction table for taxpayer's expense claims.

  CONVERSATION PROTOCOL:
  - Start your response immediately with "DOCUMENT_TYPE: BANK_STATEMENT"
  - Do NOT include conversational text like "I'll extract..." or "Based on the document..."
  - Do NOT use bullet points, numbered lists, asterisks, or markdown formatting
  - Output ONLY the structured extraction data below
  - End immediately after "TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID:" with no additional text
  - NO explanations, NO comments, NO additional text

  ## STEP 1: LOCATE THE TRANSACTION TABLE
  Focus on the main transaction table in the document, typically located in the center/body area.
  The table will have columns including: Date, Description, Debit/Withdrawal, Credit/Deposit, Balance.
  Ignore page headers, footers, account summaries, and advertisement sections.

  ## STEP 2: IDENTIFY DEBIT TRANSACTIONS
  TARGET COLUMNS: Date column + Description column + Debit/Withdrawal amount column

  For each table row, check:
  - Does it have a value in the DEBIT/WITHDRAWAL column? → Extract this row
  - Does it have a value in the CREDIT/DEPOSIT column only? → SKIP this row
  - Keywords indicating DEBIT: withdrawal, payment, purchase, debit, fee, charge, ATM, EFTPOS, transfer out
  - Keywords indicating CREDIT to skip: deposit, credit, salary, transfer in, interest received, refund

  ## STEP 3: EXTRACT ROW-BY-ROW
  For EACH debit transaction row identified in Step 2:
  1. Extract the DATE from the date column (format as DD/MM/YYYY)
  2. Extract the DESCRIPTION from the description column (exact text)
  3. Extract the AMOUNT from the debit/withdrawal column (include $ symbol)
  4. Add each extracted value to its respective field with " | " separator

  CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
  - Every transaction row has a date, but EITHER a debit OR credit value (never both)
  - The row may have a running balance at the end - ignore balance column
  - Extract ONLY rows with debit/withdrawal amounts (money OUT)
  - IGNORE rows with credit/deposit amounts (money IN)
  - The number of entries in TRANSACTION_DATES, LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS, and TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID must match exactly
  - If multiple transactions occur on the same date, extract each as a separate entry
  - Process rows in chronological order (top to bottom in table)

  EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (DO NOT EXTRACT):
  - Salary deposits or payments (money IN)
  - Interest received or interest payment (money IN)
  - Refunds or returns (money IN)
  - Any row with value in CREDIT/DEPOSIT column
  - Any transaction that increases account balance

  ## MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT (5 FIELDS):

  DOCUMENT_TYPE: BANK_STATEMENT
  STATEMENT_DATE_RANGE: [statement date range from document]
  TRANSACTION_DATES: [actual dates in DD/MM/YYYY format separated by " | "]
  LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS: [actual transaction descriptions separated by " | "]
  TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID: [actual amounts with $ separated by " | "]

  STOP AFTER TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID. Do not add explanations or comments.
```
