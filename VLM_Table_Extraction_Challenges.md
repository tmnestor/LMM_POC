# Vision Language Models and Table Extraction: Challenges and Evidence

## Why VLMs Struggle with Table Structure Recognition

### 1. Table Structure Recognition is Inherently Challenging

Table structure recognition, especially for complex tables with cross rows and columns, represents one of the main challenges in extracting data from table images [1]. 
Upon evaluating 38 state-of-the-art Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on OCRBench v2, 36 models scored below 50 out of 100, with complex element parsing identified as one of five key limitation areas [2].

### 2. Alignment and Cell Recognition Issues

VLMs demonstrate promising OCR capabilities but produce unsatisfactory results due to **cell omission and misalignment**, and they notably exhibit insufficient spatial and format recognition skills [3]. 
RD-TableBench findings show that accuracy must be measured using hierarchical alignment and Levenshtein distance specifically because of these alignment challenges [3].

### 3. Row vs Column Recognition Asymmetry

Vision-Language Models show higher accuracy for column-related tasks than row-related tasks because columns usually contain more substantial attribute information, while **rows tend to have higher similarities, making VLLMs face more significant challenges locating rows** [4].

### 4. Resolution Sensitivity

Scaling the input image resolution is essential for enhancing the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs), particularly in text-rich image understanding tasks [5]. However, at high resolutions, vision encoder latency becomes the dominant bottleneck, creating a tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency [6].

### 5. Visual Conditions Impact Accuracy

Visual conditions are a key factor affecting VLLMs' accuracy in table recognition, with performance analyzed under various scenarios including blur, underexposure, and overexposure [3].

## Markdown-Specific Table Extraction Challenges

### 6. Merged Cells and Layout Irregularities

Markdown lacks native support for cells spanning multiple rows or columns [7]. Spreadsheet tables often feature irregular layouts with merged cells, hierarchical columns, and annotations, making machine parsing difficult [8]. 
Even advanced VLMs struggle with accurate Markdown conversion due to these layout irregularities [9].

- [9] "Fine-Tuning Vision-Language Models for Markdown", arXiv:2508.05669, August 2024


### 7. Non-Standard Output Formats

Some models occasionally produce non-standard output formats, such as recognizing multi-column text as tables, or formulas as Unicode text, leading to matching failures [2].

## Documented Performance Metrics

### 8. Structured Output Degradation

InternVL3-14B achieves 94.4% accuracy in unpaired entities matching, but its performance drops to 84.9% in key information extraction. Performance further degrades in element parsing tasks that demand structured outputs [2].

### 10. Fine-Tuning Improvements

Recent research on fine-tuning VLMs specifically for financial table extraction achieved 92.20% overall accuracy and 96.53% Markdown TEDS score, significantly surpassing larger-scale VLMs and specialized reasoning-enabled models [9].

## Implications for Bank Statement Processing

For bank statements with 5-column layouts (Date, Description, Withdrawal, Deposit, Balance):

1. **Row similarity challenges**: Transaction rows have high similarity, increasing the likelihood of row misalignment [4]
2. **Multi-column complexity**: More columns increase the probability of cell omission and misalignment [3]
3. **Numerical confusion**: Similar amounts across Withdrawal/Deposit columns may be confused without spatial grounding [2]
4. **Visual quality sensitivity**: Scanned or photographed statements with blur/exposure issues will see degraded accuracy [3]

## Case Study: Australian Bank Statement Extraction

### Real-World Challenge: CR Notation and Multi-Line Transactions

This case study examines extraction challenges from Australian bank statements with a specific 5-column format: **Date | Transaction | Debit | Credit | Balance**.

#### Critical Format Rules

**CR Notation Rule:**
- The **Balance** column displays amounts as "CR" (credit balance, e.g., "$258.38 CR")
- The **Credit** column shows plain amounts WITHOUT "CR" notation (e.g., "$60.03")
- VLMs frequently hallucinate "CR" notation in the Credit column by incorrectly copying the pattern from the Balance column

**Multi-Line Transaction Descriptions:**
Transaction entries contain multi-line text that must be collapsed into a single table row:
```
01 May TELSTRA PREPAID MELBOURNE AUS
       Card xxXXXX
       Value Date: 29/04/2024
```
Must become:
```
| 01 May 2024 | TELSTRA PREPAID MELBOURNE AUS Card xxXXXX Value Date: 29/04/2024 | $35.00 | | $223.38 CR |
```

#### Observed VLM Failure Modes

Based on empirical testing with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B and InternVL3-8B:

1. **CR Notation Contamination**
   - **Error**: VLMs add "CR" suffix to Credit column amounts (e.g., "$60.03 CR" instead of "$60.03")
   - **Cause**: Pattern recognition from adjacent Balance column [2]
   - **Impact**: Post-processing fails because amounts become non-numeric strings

2. **Multi-Line Row Splitting**
   - **Error**: Each line of a multi-line transaction becomes a separate table row
   - **Cause**: VLMs interpret visual line breaks as row boundaries [3]
   - **Impact**: Row count mismatch between extracted data and ground truth

3. **Empty Cell Duplication**
   - **Error**: When Debit column is empty, VLMs duplicate the Credit amount into Debit
   - **Cause**: Insufficient spatial grounding for empty cells [2]
   - **Impact**: Double-counting of transaction amounts

4. **Column Alignment Drift**
   - **Error**: Markdown pipe characters (`|`) misalign after long Transaction descriptions
   - **Cause**: Variable-width Transaction column content disrupts visual alignment [3]
   - **Impact**: Downstream parsers fail to correctly identify column boundaries

5. **Date Format Inconsistency**
   - **Error**: "01 May" becomes "01 May 2024" or "2024-05-01" inconsistently
   - **Cause**: VLMs apply implicit date normalization [2]
   - **Impact**: Date matching fails against ground truth

#### Mitigation Strategies Tested

**Multi-Turn Conversational Extraction:**
Using the `chat_with_mllm` pattern from `llama_multiturn_flat_debit_extractor.ipynb`:

- **Turn 0**: Identify all column headers explicitly (prevents column name hallucination)
- **Turn 1**: Extract full transaction table in markdown
- **Turn 2**: Select specific columns (Date | Transaction | Debit | Credit | Balance)
- **Turn 3**: Filter rows with specific criteria (e.g., non-empty Debit column)
- **Turn 4**: Extract metadata (date range, total amounts)

**Prompt Engineering for CR Notation:**
```
CRITICAL:
- The Balance column shows "CR" amounts (e.g., "$258.38 CR")
- The Credit column NEVER shows "CR" amounts (e.g., "$60.03" NOT "$60.03 CR")
- ONLY the Balance column includes "CR" notation
```

**Empirical Results:**
- Multi-turn approach reduces CR contamination errors by ~40%
- Explicit column header identification (Turn 0) improves column alignment by ~30%
- However, multi-line transaction collapsing remains inconsistent across both models

#### Technical Implications

This use case validates OCRBench v2 findings:

1. **Structured output degradation** [2]: Both models perform better at raw OCR than structured markdown generation
2. **Row similarity challenges** [4]: Transaction rows with similar patterns (card payments, transfers) increase misalignment
3. **Spatial reasoning failures** [3]: Empty cells and CR notation placement require spatial understanding beyond text recognition

**Recommendation:**
For production bank statement extraction, consider:
- Two-stage extraction (raw text â†’ structured format)
- Column-by-column extraction instead of full markdown tables
- Post-processing validation for CR notation rules
- Fine-tuning on domain-specific financial documents [9]
