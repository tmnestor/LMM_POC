description: "Template for extracting specific columns from bank statement transaction tables using detected column names"

# Note: The instruction field will be dynamically generated using header_mapping.generate_extraction_instruction()
# This template defines the output format only

output_format: |
  Return as pipe-separated values with exactly these headers:
  Date | Description | Debit

  For each transaction row, output one line in this format:
  {date_value} | {description_value} | {debit_amount}

  Rules:
  - Use " | " (space-pipe-space) as delimiter
  - If debit column is empty/blank for a row, leave the debit field empty
  - Only include debit amounts (withdrawals), not credits (deposits)
  - Extract ALL transaction rows from the table
  - Do NOT include the header row in your output
  - Do NOT add any explanatory text before or after the data

  Example output:
  Date | Description | Debit
  01/06/2024 | EFTPOS Purchase - WOOLWORTHS | 45.60
  01/06/2024 | ATM Withdrawal | 100.00
  02/06/2024 | Direct Debit - ELECTRICITY | 156.78
