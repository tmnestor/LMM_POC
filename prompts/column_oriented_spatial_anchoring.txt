COLUMN-ORIENTED BANK STATEMENT EXTRACTION WITH SPATIAL ANCHORING
================================================================

You are an expert at extracting data from Australian bank statements.

TASK: Extract each column separately by reading DIRECTLY UNDER each column header.

STEP 1 - IDENTIFY COLUMN HEADERS:
Look at the table header row. You should see 5 column headers:
- Column header 1: "Date" or "Date of Transaction"
- Column header 2: "Transaction" or "Description"
- Column header 3: "Debit" or "Withdrawal"
- Column header 4: "Credit" or "Deposit"
- Column header 5: "Balance"

STEP 2 - EXTRACT COLUMN BY COLUMN USING SPATIAL POSITION:

For DATE column (Column 1):
- Read ONLY the text positioned DIRECTLY UNDER the "Date" header
- This is typically SHORT text like "15 Mar" or "15 Mar 2024"
- Do NOT include text that extends into the next column

For TRANSACTION column (Column 2):
- Read ONLY the text positioned DIRECTLY UNDER the "Transaction" or "Description" header
- This is typically LONGER text describing the transaction
- If the description spans multiple lines vertically, combine them
- Do NOT include the date from the previous column

For DEBIT column (Column 3):
- Read amounts positioned DIRECTLY UNDER the "Debit" or "Withdrawal" header
- If empty, write "EMPTY"

For CREDIT column (Column 4):
- Read amounts positioned DIRECTLY UNDER the "Credit" or "Deposit" header
- If empty, write "EMPTY"
- NEVER add "CR" suffix

For BALANCE column (Column 5):
- Read amounts positioned DIRECTLY UNDER the "Balance" header
- Preserve "CR" notation exactly as shown

CRITICAL SPATIAL RULE:
Think of each column as a VERTICAL strip under its header. Only extract text within that vertical strip.

Example of CORRECT spatial extraction:
```
Headers:  | Date    | Transaction              | Debit   | Credit  | Balance      |
Row 1:    | 15 Mar  | SUPERMARKET PAYMENT      | $45.00  | EMPTY   | $1,200.00 CR |
```
DATE_COLUMN: "15 Mar" (NOT "15 Mar SUPERMARKET PAYMENT")
TRANSACTION_COLUMN: "SUPERMARKET PAYMENT" (NOT "Card details" if that's on next line)

OUTPUT FORMAT:

DATE_COLUMN:
[First date] | [Second date] | [Third date] | ...

TRANSACTION_COLUMN:
[First description] | [Second description] | [Third description] | ...

DEBIT_COLUMN:
[First amount or EMPTY] | [Second amount or EMPTY] | ...

CREDIT_COLUMN:
[First amount or EMPTY] | [Second amount or EMPTY] | ...

BALANCE_COLUMN:
[First balance] | [Second balance] | ...

Begin extraction by first identifying the column headers, then extract each column's data.
