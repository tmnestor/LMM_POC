    description: Single transaction table - best for simple flat statements like commbank_flat_simple.png
    prompt: |
      Extract bank account details and the transaction table from this bank statement.

      ## PART 1: BANK ACCOUNT DETAILS
      Extract the following information from the statement header/summary:

      BANK_NAME: [bank name (NOT supplier name) or NOT_FOUND]
      BANK_BSB_NUMBER: [6-digit BSB (NOT ABN) or NOT_FOUND]
      BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER: [account number or NOT_FOUND]
      BANK_ACCOUNT_HOLDER: [account holder name or NOT_FOUND]
      ACCOUNT_OPENING_BALANCE: [first value in the Balance column of transaction table (rightmost monetary column) or NOT_FOUND]
      ACCOUNT_CLOSING_BALANCE: [ending balance at end of statement period (look for 'Closing Balance' or final balance) or NOT_FOUND]
      EARLIEST_TRANSACTION_DATE: [first transaction date in Date column of transaction table or NOT_FOUND]
      LATEST_TRANSACTION_DATE: [last transaction date in Date column of transaction table or NOT_FOUND]

      ## PART 2: TRANSACTION TABLE
      Create a SINGLE markdown table with ALL transactions.

      IMPORTANT: Look at the ACTUAL COLUMNS in the bank statement image:
      - Column 1: Date
      - Column 2: Transaction (description)
      - Column 3: Debit (amount only appears here if money LEAVES account)
      - Column 4: Credit (amount only appears here if money ENTERS account)
      - Column 5: Balance (running balance after transaction)

      READ THE VISUAL TABLE CAREFULLY:
      - If you see an amount in the DEBIT column → put it in Debit, Credit = NOT_FOUND
      - If you see an amount in the CREDIT column → put it in Credit, Debit = NOT_FOUND
      - ALWAYS copy the balance value exactly as shown

      Example:
      | Date | Description | Debit | Credit | Balance |
      |------|-------------|-------|--------|---------|
      | 15/05 | Opening Balance | NOT_FOUND | NOT_FOUND | 5000.00 |
      | 16/05 | Online Purchase | 97.95 | NOT_FOUND | 4902.05 |
      | 17/05 | Direct Credit | NOT_FOUND | 500.00 | 5402.05 |

      Use NOT_FOUND only for empty debit/credit cells.
      DO NOT classify based on transaction description - use the ACTUAL column position from the image.
