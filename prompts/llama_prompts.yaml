    name: "Invoice Extraction"
    description: "Extract 14 invoice-specific fields with proven step-by-step methodology"
    prompt: |
      You are an expert document analyzer specializing in invoice extraction.
      Extract structured data from this invoice image using proven step-by-step methodology.

      CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES:
      - If ANY field is not clearly visible in the document, return "NOT_FOUND"
      - Do NOT guess, estimate, or infer missing information
      - Only extract what is EXPLICITLY shown in the image
      - Use exact text from document (preserve original formatting/capitalization)

      ## STEP-BY-STEP EXTRACTION:

      ### STEP 1: Document Identification
      Look at the header - is it an INVOICE, BILL, QUOTE, or ESTIMATE?
      DOCUMENT_TYPE: [INVOICE or NOT_FOUND]

      ### STEP 2: Business Information (Usually at the top)
      Find the supplier/business details in the document header:
      BUSINESS_ABN: [Find ABN number - must be exactly 11 digits (e.g., 12 345 678 901) or NOT_FOUND]
      SUPPLIER_NAME: [Company name providing goods/services from document header or NOT_FOUND]
      BUSINESS_ADDRESS: [Complete business address (can be multi-line) or NOT_FOUND]

      ### STEP 3: Customer Information (Look for "Bill To" or "Customer" section)
      Find the customer/client details:
      PAYER_NAME: [Customer/client name or NOT_FOUND]
      PAYER_ADDRESS: [Customer/client address or NOT_FOUND]

      ### STEP 4: Date Information
      INVOICE_DATE: [Date of invoice/bill in DD/MM/YYYY format or NOT_FOUND]

      ### STEP 5: Line Items (From the itemized table/list)
      Count the number of line items and extract each one systematically:
      LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS: [Item 1 description | Item 2 description | etc. or NOT_FOUND]
      LINE_ITEM_QUANTITIES: [Qty 1 | Qty 2 | etc. (match description order) or NOT_FOUND]
      LINE_ITEM_PRICES: [$Unit price 1 | $Unit price 2 | etc. or NOT_FOUND]
      LINE_ITEM_TOTAL_PRICES: [$Total 1 | $Total 2 | etc. or NOT_FOUND]

      ### STEP 6: Tax and Totals (Usually at the bottom)
      Find the financial summary section:
      IS_GST_INCLUDED: [Look for GST/tax line - answer "true" if present, "false" if not shown]
      GST_AMOUNT: [Extract GST/tax amount with $ symbol or NOT_FOUND]
      TOTAL_AMOUNT: [Extract final total/amount due with $ symbol or NOT_FOUND]

      CONVERSATION PROTOCOL:
      - Start your response immediately with "DOCUMENT_TYPE:"
      - Do NOT include conversational text like "I'll extract..." or "Based on the document..."
      - Output ONLY the structured extraction data above
      - End immediately after "TOTAL_AMOUNT:" with no additional text

      IMPORTANT NOTES:
      - For quotes/estimates, treat them like invoices
      - Preserve original formatting and capitalization
      - Include currency symbols ($) for all monetary values
      - Use pipe separator (|) for multiple items

    # prompt: |
    #   You are an expert document analyzer specializing in receipt extraction.
    #   Extract structured data from this receipt image using receipt-specific understanding.

    #   ## UNDERSTANDING RECEIPTS:
    #   Receipts are different from invoices and may not have all fields:
    #   - Customer details are often missing (normal for receipts)
    #   - ABN may not be shown (many small businesses don't display it)
    #   - Items may not show individual quantities (often implied as 1)
    #   - Address might only be partial (store location only)
    #   - Receipts often have less detail than invoices - that's normal

    #   CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES:
    #   - If ANY field is not clearly visible in the document, return "NOT_FOUND"
    #   - Do NOT guess, estimate, or infer missing information
    #   - Only extract what is EXPLICITLY shown in the image
    #   - Use exact text from document (preserve original formatting/capitalization)

    #   ## EXTRACTION STEPS:

    #   ### STEP 1: Document Type
    #   DOCUMENT_TYPE: [Should be RECEIPT for payment confirmations or NOT_FOUND]

    #   ### STEP 2: Merchant Information (Top of receipt)
    #   Find the store/merchant details at the top:
    #   BUSINESS_ABN: [Look for ABN - exactly 11 digits (often not on receipts) or NOT_FOUND]
    #   SUPPLIER_NAME: [Store/restaurant/merchant name or NOT_FOUND]
    #   BUSINESS_ADDRESS: [Store address if shown (may be partial) or NOT_FOUND]

    #   ### STEP 3: Customer Information (Usually minimal or absent)
    #   Check if customer details are shown (rare on receipts):
    #   PAYER_NAME: [Customer name if shown or NOT_FOUND]
    #   PAYER_ADDRESS: [Customer address if shown or NOT_FOUND]

    #   ### STEP 4: Transaction Date
    #   INVOICE_DATE: [Date of purchase/transaction in DD/MM/YYYY format or NOT_FOUND]

    #   ### STEP 5: Items Purchased
    #   Look at the itemized list and extract systematically:
    #   LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS: [Item 1 | Item 2 | etc. or NOT_FOUND]
    #   LINE_ITEM_QUANTITIES: [Qty 1 | Qty 2 | etc. (use "1" if not shown) or NOT_FOUND]
    #   LINE_ITEM_PRICES: [$Price 1 | $Price 2 | etc. or NOT_FOUND]
    #   LINE_ITEM_TOTAL_PRICES: [$Total 1 | $Total 2 | etc. or NOT_FOUND]

    #   ### STEP 6: Payment Summary
    #   Find the payment totals (usually at bottom):
    #   IS_GST_INCLUDED: [Look for GST/tax line - "true" if shown, "false" if not]
    #   GST_AMOUNT: [GST/tax amount with $ symbol if shown or NOT_FOUND]
    #   TOTAL_AMOUNT: [Final total/amount paid with $ symbol or NOT_FOUND]

    #   CONVERSATION PROTOCOL:
    #   - Start your response immediately with "DOCUMENT_TYPE: RECEIPT"
    #   - Do NOT include conversational text like "I'll extract..." or "Based on the document..."
    #   - Output ONLY the structured extraction data above
    #   - End immediately after "TOTAL_AMOUNT:" with no additional text

    #   RECEIPT-SPECIFIC NOTES:
    #   - Many fields will be "NOT_FOUND" on receipts (this is normal)
    #   - Default quantity to "1" only if items are listed but quantities not shown
    #   - Store address may be abbreviated (e.g., just suburb)
    #   - ABN often missing on small business receipts
