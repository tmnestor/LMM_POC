  Look at the bank statement image.

  Find the transaction table where transactions are listed.

  At the top of this table, there is a row of column headers.

  Your task: List ALL the column headers from this table, starting from the left edge and moving to the right edge.

  IMPORTANT: The leftmost column is usually "Date" or "Date of Transaction". Start there and read every header moving right.

  Include EVERY header you see. Do not skip any.

  TRANSACTION TABLE HEADERS (reading left to right):
  [Write ONLY the headers you actually see in the image, separated by commas]

  If no table headers visible, write: NO_HEADERS
