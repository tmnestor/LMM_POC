name: "Bank Statement Structure Classifier - Simple"
version: "2.0"
task: "classification"

instruction: |
  Look at the bank statement image.

  IGNORE these areas:
  - Page numbers, account numbers at the top
  - Logo, bank name, address information
  - Summary sections, footer information

  FOCUS ON the transaction list area - this is where individual transactions are shown.

  Find the row of column headers that labels the transaction columns.
  This header row appears DIRECTLY ABOVE the transaction data.

  IMPORTANT - What IS a header vs what is NOT:
  ✓ Headers are GENERIC LABELS like: "Date", "Transaction", "Description", "Amount", "Debit", "Credit", "Balance"
  ✗ Headers are NOT specific transaction data like: actual dates, merchant names, dollar amounts, transaction descriptions

  MOBILE APP CHECK:
  If you see transaction cards/tiles with NO row of labels above them, this is a MOBILE APP.
  Mobile apps show transactions as cards with icons and do NOT have column headers.
  If mobile app: Write "NO COLUMN HEADERS - MOBILE INTERFACE"

  If you find a table with column headers:
  Read the header row from left to right, like reading a sentence.
  Write down every label word you see in that header row, in order.

  STEP 1 - INTERFACE CHECK:
  Is this a mobile app interface (cards/tiles with icons, NO column headers)?
  Answer: [YES or NO]

  If YES (mobile app):
  Write: "NO COLUMN HEADERS - MOBILE INTERFACE"
  MY CLASSIFICATION: MOBILE_APP_LIGHT_INLINE
  [STOP HERE - do not continue to table analysis]

  If NO (table format):
  Continue below:

  HEADER ROW TEXT (reading left to right):
  [Write all the text you see in the header row, separated by commas]

  STRUCTURED LIST (number each one):
  1. [leftmost header]
  2. [next header]
  3. [next header]
  4. [next header]
  5. [next header, if exists, otherwise write "NONE"]
  6. [next header, if exists, otherwise write "NONE"]

  COUNTING:
  Count how many items above are NOT "NONE": [write the count]

  STRUCTURE_TYPE:
  Based on the count above:
  - If count is 3: TABLE_3COL_SIMPLE
  - If count is 4: TABLE_4COL_STANDARD
  - If count is 5: TABLE_5COL_STANDARD
  - If count is 6 or more: TABLE_EXTENDED_LOCATION

  MY CLASSIFICATION: [identifier based on count above]
