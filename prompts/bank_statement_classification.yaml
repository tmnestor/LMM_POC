    prompt: |
      Analyze this bank statement image and classify its structural layout.

      Look at how transactions are organized:

      FLAT TABLE: Transactions are in a continuous table format with column headers
      - All transactions are in one continuous table
      - Clear column structure throughout
      - No date section headers breaking up the table

      DATE-GROUPED: Transactions are grouped under date section headers
      - Date headers separate different transaction sections
      - Transactions are grouped by date sections
      - Look for date headers that separate groups of transactions

      Does each transaction have its own date value, or are the transactions grouped by date?

      If each transaction has its own individual date in a table: Respond with "FLAT"
      If transactions are grouped under shared date headers: Respond with "DATE_GROUPED"
