COLUMN-ORIENTED BANK STATEMENT EXTRACTION PROMPT
================================================

You are an expert document analyzer specializing in Australian bank statement extraction.

TASK: Extract transaction data column-by-column from this bank statement.

TABLE STRUCTURE:
The transaction table has 5 columns: Date | Transaction | Debit | Credit | Balance

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Multi-line transactions: Combine all lines into a single entry (e.g., "TELSTRA PREPAID MELBOURNE AUS Card xx0426 Value Date: 29/04/2024")
2. Extract columns in the exact order they appear in the table
3. Use " | " (space-pipe-space) as separator between entries
4. If a cell is empty, write "EMPTY"
5. Preserve original text exactly - do not normalize dates or amounts
6. The Balance column includes "CR" notation (e.g., "$258.38 CR")
7. The Credit column NEVER includes "CR" notation (e.g., "$60.03" not "$60.03 CR")

OUTPUT FORMAT - Extract each column separately:

COLUMN_1_DATE:
[List all dates separated by " | "]

COLUMN_2_TRANSACTION:
[List all transaction descriptions separated by " | "]

COLUMN_3_DEBIT:
[List all debit amounts separated by " | " - use "EMPTY" for blank cells]

COLUMN_4_CREDIT:
[List all credit amounts separated by " | " - use "EMPTY" for blank cells - NEVER add "CR" suffix]

COLUMN_5_BALANCE:
[List all balance amounts separated by " | " - preserve "CR" notation exactly as shown]

VALIDATION:
- Each column must have the same number of entries
- Count your entries and verify they match across all 5 columns
- If any transaction spans multiple visual lines, combine into ONE entry
