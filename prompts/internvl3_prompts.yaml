    description: "Optimized for date-grouped bank statements - taxpayer expense claims (5 fields)"
    prompt: |
      Extract structured data from this date-grouped bank statement for taxpayer expense claims.

      STEP 1 - LOCATE DATE-GROUPED SECTIONS:
      Focus on main transaction area in document body.
      Structure: Date headers (e.g., "Thu 04 Sep 2025") with transactions listed below.
      Under each date: Description + Amount columns
      Ignore: Headers, footers, summaries, advertisements

      STEP 2 - IDENTIFY DEBIT TRANSACTIONS:
      For each date header section:
      TARGET DATA: Transaction description + Amount (negative or explicit debit)

      For each transaction under date header check:
      - Is this DEBIT/WITHDRAWAL (money OUT)? → Extract
      - Is this CREDIT/DEPOSIT (money IN)? → SKIP
      - DEBIT keywords: withdrawal, payment, purchase, debit, fee, charge, ATM, EFTPOS, card purchase
      - CREDIT keywords to skip: deposit, credit, salary, transfer in, interest received, refund, income

      STEP 3 - EXTRACT TRANSACTION-BY-TRANSACTION:
      For EACH debit transaction:
      1. Extract DATE from date header above (DD/MM/YYYY format)
      2. Extract DESCRIPTION from transaction row (exact text)
      3. Extract AMOUNT from transaction row (with $ symbol)
      4. Add to output with " | " separator

      CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
      - Extract ONLY debits/withdrawals (money OUT)
      - IGNORE credits/deposits (money IN)
      - Dates, descriptions, and amounts must have same count
      - Multiple transactions per date = separate entries with same date
      - Process chronologically (top to bottom through date headers)

      EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (DO NOT EXTRACT):
      - Salary deposits or payments (money IN)
      - Interest received or interest payment (money IN)
      - Refunds or returns (money IN)
      - Any credit/deposit transaction
      - Any transaction that increases account balance

      STATEMENT_DATE_RANGE: NOT_FOUND
      LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS: NOT_FOUND
