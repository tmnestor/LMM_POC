      amounts (money going out) separated by '' | '' - include $ symbol or NOT_FOUND]

      LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS: [From the transaction table, extract ALL transaction
      descriptions separated by '' | '' in same order as dates or NOT_FOUND]


      CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES:

      - Each line must be: FIELDNAME: value

      - For transaction lists: Count the rows in transaction table carefully

      - TRANSACTION_DATES, TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID, and LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS must
      have same number of elements

      - Use pipe separation (|) for multiple values: value1 | value2 | value3

      - Include $ symbol for monetary amounts

      - Use ''NOT_FOUND'' ONLY when the field truly doesn''t exist in the document

      - Date format: DD/MM/YYYY

      - If a transaction row has no amount, include ''NOT_FOUND'' as placeholder to
      maintain alignment


      OUTPUT EXACTLY 7 LINES. Stop after LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS.'
