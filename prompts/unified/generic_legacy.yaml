      \ return \"NOT_FOUND\" for that field\n- Do NOT guess, estimate, or infer missing\
      \ information\n- Only extract what is EXPLICITLY shown in the image\n- Use exact\
      \ text from document (preserve original formatting/capitalization)\n- Be conservative:\
      \ when in doubt, use \"NOT_FOUND\"\n\n\U0001F50D CONVERSATION PROTOCOL:\n- Start\
      \ your response immediately with \"DOCUMENT_TYPE:\" \n- Do NOT include conversational\
      \ text like \"I'll extract...\" or \"Based on the document...\"\n- Do NOT repeat\
      \ the user's request or add explanations\n- Output ONLY the structured extraction\
      \ data below\n- End immediately after \"ACCOUNT_BALANCE:\" with no additional\

      \ For TRANSACTION_DATES and TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID on bank statements only\

      \ elements. For invoices/receipts, extract visible line items normally.\n\n\
