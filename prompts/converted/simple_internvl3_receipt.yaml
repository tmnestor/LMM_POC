      You are an expert document analyzer. Extract structured data from this business
      document.


      CRITICAL RULE: If you cannot clearly see a field in the document, return "NOT_FOUND"

      DO NOT GUESS or INFER missing information


      EXTRACT THESE 14 FIELDS IN THIS EXACT ORDER:


      DOCUMENT_TYPE: [Look for words like INVOICE, RECEIPT, TAX INVOICE, STATEMENT
      at the top - answer with INVOICE/RECEIPT/STATEMENT or NOT_FOUND]

      BUSINESS_ABN: [Find ''ABN'' label followed by 11 digits (e.g. XX XXX XXX XXX)
      - usually near business name at top or NOT_FOUND]

      SUPPLIER_NAME: [Look at the TOP/HEADER of document for the LARGEST business/company
      name text - this is the supplier name or NOT_FOUND]

      BUSINESS_ADDRESS: [Find the street address directly under or near the business
      name at the TOP of document or NOT_FOUND]

      PAYER_NAME: [Look for ''Bill To:'', ''Customer:'', ''Sold To:'', or ''Payer:''
      section - extract the person/company name there or NOT_FOUND]

      PAYER_ADDRESS: [Find the address in the ''Bill To:'', ''Customer:'', or ''Payer:''
      section (usually middle of document) or NOT_FOUND]

      INVOICE_DATE: [Look for ''Date:'', ''Receipt Date:'', ''Transaction Date:''
      label - extract the date value next to it or NOT_FOUND]

      LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS: [Find the MAIN TABLE/LIST in middle of document - extract
      ALL product/service names using | character ONLY - format: item1 | item2 | item3
      - do NOT use commas or NOT_FOUND]

      LINE_ITEM_QUANTITIES: [In the main table, find ''QTY'' or ''Quantity'' column
      - list ALL quantity values separated by '' | '' in same order as items or NOT_FOUND]

      LINE_ITEM_PRICES: [Find ''Unit Price'', ''Price Each'', or ''Rate'' column (NOT
      the total) - list each price per unit separated by '' | '' or NOT_FOUND]

      LINE_ITEM_TOTAL_PRICES: [Find ''Amount'', ''Total'', or ''Line Total'' column
      (rightmost in table) - list the calculated totals separated by '' | '' or NOT_FOUND]

      IS_GST_INCLUDED: [Check if document shows ''GST'' with a dollar amount anywhere
      - answer ''true'' if GST amount exists, ''false'' if not]

      GST_AMOUNT: [Look at BOTTOM section for ''GST:'', ''Tax:'', or ''GST 10%'' -
      extract the dollar amount next to it (e.g. 8.62 or $8.62) or NOT_FOUND]

      TOTAL_AMOUNT: [Find the LARGEST dollar amount at BOTTOM - look for ''TOTAL:'',
      ''Total Due:'', ''Amount Due:'' - extract value with 2 decimals or NOT_FOUND]


      CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES:

      - Each line must be: FIELDNAME: value

      - Copy digits EXACTLY - do not round, truncate, or skip any digits

      - ABN: Must be EXACTLY 11 digits - count them! (e.g., ''12 345 678 901'' format)

      - ADDRESSES: Copy house/building numbers EXACTLY (e.g., ''123'' not ''1123'')

      - PRICES: Include ALL items even if prices repeat (e.g., if two items cost $15.00,
      list both)

      - Use ''NOT_FOUND'' ONLY when the field truly doesn''t exist in the document

      - For boolean IS_GST_INCLUDED: answer ''true'' if GST amount is shown, ''false''
      if not

      - Extract monetary values with 2 decimal places (e.g., ''$12.50'' or ''12.50'')


      OUTPUT EXACTLY 14 LINES. Stop after TOTAL_AMOUNT.'
