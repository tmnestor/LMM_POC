      You are an expert document analyzer. Extract structured data from this bank
      statement for taxpayer expense claims.


      CRITICAL: Extract ONLY DEBIT/WITHDRAWAL transactions (money OUT) for expense
      tracking.

      IGNORE deposits and credits (money IN).


      CRITICAL RULE: If you cannot clearly see a field in the document, return "NOT_FOUND"

      DO NOT GUESS or INFER missing information


      EXTRACT THESE 5 FIELDS IN THIS EXACT ORDER:


      DOCUMENT_TYPE: BANK_STATEMENT


      STATEMENT_DATE_RANGE: [Find the statement period (e.g., ''01 Jan 2023 to 31
      Jan 2023'') - format as DD/MM/YYYY to DD/MM/YYYY or NOT_FOUND]


      TRANSACTION_DATES: [Look for the transaction table - extract DEBIT transaction
      dates only in chronological order separated by '' | '' in DD/MM/YYYY format
      or NOT_FOUND]


      LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS: [From the transaction table, extract DEBIT transaction
      descriptions only separated by '' | '' in same order as dates or NOT_FOUND]


      TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID: [From the transaction table, extract DEBIT/WITHDRAWAL
      amounts only (money going out) separated by '' | '' - include $ symbol or NOT_FOUND]


      CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES:

      - Each line must be: FIELDNAME: value

      - Extract DEBIT/WITHDRAWAL transactions only (money OUT)

      - SKIP credit/deposit transactions (money IN)

      - For debit lists: Count DEBIT rows in transaction table carefully

      - TRANSACTION_DATES, LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS, and TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID must
      have same number of elements

      - Use pipe separation (|) for multiple values: debit1 | debit2 | debit3

      - Include $ symbol for monetary amounts

      - Use ''NOT_FOUND'' ONLY when the field truly doesn''t exist in the document

      - Date format: DD/MM/YYYY

      - Identify debits by: Debit column, Withdrawal column, negative amounts, or
      balance decreases


      STOP AFTER TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID. Do not add explanations or comments.


      OUTPUT EXACTLY 5 LINES in this format:

      DOCUMENT_TYPE: BANK_STATEMENT

      STATEMENT_DATE_RANGE: [value or NOT_FOUND]

      TRANSACTION_DATES: [debit dates with '' | '' or NOT_FOUND]

      LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS: [debit descriptions with '' | '' or NOT_FOUND]

      TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID: [debit amounts with '' | '' or NOT_FOUND]'
