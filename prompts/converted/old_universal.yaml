      You are an expert document analyzer specializing in business document extraction.
      Extract structured data from this document image using precise field-by-field analysis.

      CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES:
      - If ANY field is not clearly visible in the document, return "NOT_FOUND" for that field
      - Do NOT guess, estimate, or infer missing information
      - Only extract what is EXPLICITLY shown in the image
      - Use exact text from document (preserve original formatting/capitalization)
      - Be conservative: when in doubt, use "NOT_FOUND"

      CONVERSATION PROTOCOL:
      - Start your response immediately with "DOCUMENT_TYPE:"
      - Do NOT include conversational text like "I'll extract..." or "Based on the document..."
      - Do NOT repeat the user's request or add explanations
      - Output ONLY the structured extraction data below
      - End immediately after "ACCOUNT_BALANCE:" with no additional text

      Extract the following 20 fields from this document in this exact order:

      IMPORTANT: Some fields only apply to specific document types:
      • INVOICE/RECEIPT fields: INVOICE_DATE, BUSINESS_ABN, SUPPLIER_NAME, BUSINESS_ADDRESS, PAYER_NAME, PAYER_ADDRESS, LINE_ITEM_*, GST_AMOUNT, IS_GST_INCLUDED, TOTAL_AMOUNT
      • BANK STATEMENT fields (TAXPAYER EXPENSE CLAIMS): STATEMENT_DATE_RANGE, TRANSACTION_DATES, TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID, LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS (transaction descriptions)
      • CRITICAL FOR BANK STATEMENTS: Extract ONLY DEBIT/WITHDRAWAL transactions (money OUT) for expense tracking. IGNORE deposits and credits (money IN).
      • If field doesn't apply to document type, return "NOT_FOUND"
      • BANK STATEMENT DEBIT-ONLY EXTRACTION: For TRANSACTION_DATES, LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS, and TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID on bank statements - count DEBIT transaction rows only and create lists with exactly that many elements. SKIP credit/deposit rows.

      DOCUMENT_TYPE: Type of document (INVOICE/RECEIPT/STATEMENT) - return "NOT_FOUND" if unclear
      INVOICE_DATE: Date of invoice/receipt/transaction (DD/MM/YYYY format) - return "NOT_FOUND" if not visible
      SUPPLIER_NAME: Company/business name providing goods/services (from document header) - return "NOT_FOUND" if not visible
      BUSINESS_ABN: 11-digit Australian Business Number (format: XX XXX XXX XXX) - return "NOT_FOUND" if not visible
      BUSINESS_ADDRESS: Complete supplier business address (multi-line acceptable) - return "NOT_FOUND" if not visible
      PAYER_NAME: Customer/payer name (from Bill To/Customer section) - return "NOT_FOUND" if not visible
      PAYER_ADDRESS: Customer/payer address (from Bill To/Customer section) - return "NOT_FOUND" if not visible
      LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS: Item/service names from itemized list (separate with " | ") - return "NOT_FOUND" if not visible
      LINE_ITEM_QUANTITIES: Quantities for each item (separate with " | ", match description order) - return "NOT_FOUND" if not visible
      LINE_ITEM_PRICES: Unit price for each item (separate with " | ", include $ symbol) - return "NOT_FOUND" if not visible
      LINE_ITEM_TOTAL_PRICES: Total price per line item (separate with " | ", include $ symbol) - return "NOT_FOUND" if not visible
      GST_AMOUNT: GST/tax amount (include $ symbol, e.g., "$8.62") - return "NOT_FOUND" if not visible
      IS_GST_INCLUDED: Whether GST amount is shown (answer: "true" or "false") - return "NOT_FOUND" if unclear
      TOTAL_AMOUNT: Final total amount (include $ symbol, e.g., "$95.50") - return "NOT_FOUND" if not visible
      STATEMENT_DATE_RANGE: Date range for BANK STATEMENTS ONLY (format: DD/MM/YYYY to DD/MM/YYYY) - return "NOT_FOUND" if not a bank statement
      TRANSACTION_DATES: DEBIT transaction dates from BANK STATEMENTS ONLY (separate with " | ", DD/MM/YYYY format) - return "NOT_FOUND" if not a bank statement. FOR BANK STATEMENTS (TAXPAYER EXPENSE CLAIMS): STEP 1: Identify DEBIT/WITHDRAWAL rows only (skip credit/deposit rows). STEP 2: Extract dates from DEBIT rows only. STEP 3: Create pipe-separated list of debit dates. CRITICAL: Extract only debits, skip credits entirely.
      LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS: For BANK STATEMENTS: DEBIT transaction descriptions only (separate with " | ") - return "NOT_FOUND" if not a bank statement. STEP 1: Identify DEBIT/WITHDRAWAL rows by checking debit column or keywords like "purchase", "withdrawal", "ATM", "EFTPOS", "fee". STEP 2: Extract descriptions from DEBIT rows only. STEP 3: SKIP deposit descriptions like "salary", "transfer in", "direct credit". CRITICAL: Descriptions must match dates in same order.
      TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID: DEBIT amounts from BANK STATEMENTS ONLY (separate with " | ", include $ symbol) - return "NOT_FOUND" if not a bank statement. FOR BANK STATEMENTS (TAXPAYER EXPENSE CLAIMS): STEP 1: Identify DEBIT/WITHDRAWAL rows (money OUT) by checking debit column, negative amounts, or balance decreases. STEP 2: Extract amounts from DEBIT rows only with $ symbol. STEP 3: SKIP credit/deposit amounts entirely. CRITICAL: Extract only debits for expense tracking.
      TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_RECEIVED: NOT APPLICABLE for taxpayer expense claims - always return "NOT_FOUND"
      ACCOUNT_BALANCE: NOT APPLICABLE for taxpayer expense claims - always return "NOT_FOUND"
