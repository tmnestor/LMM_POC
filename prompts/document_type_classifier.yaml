  Analyze the image and determine if it shows a mobile banking app or a traditional bank statement.

  Look for these characteristics:

  MOBILE APP indicators:
  - Touch-friendly UI elements (buttons, tabs, search bars)
  - Navigation icons (back arrow, menu, filter icons)
  - Mobile status bar (time, battery, signal)
  - Interactive elements (search box, filter button)
  - Scrollable list interface
  - Category icons or merchant logos
  - Free-form transaction layout
  - Modern app design patterns

  BANK STATEMENT indicators:
  - Fixed table structure with rows and columns
  - Formal column headers (Date, Description, Amount, Balance)
  - PDF or printed document appearance
  - Grid-like layout with aligned columns
  - No mobile UI elements
  - Formal typography and spacing
  - Traditional document format

  Choose the classification that best matches the image.
