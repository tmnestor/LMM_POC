instruction: |
  You are an expert document analyzer specializing in bank statement extraction.
  Extract structured data from this flat table bank statement for taxpayer expense claims.

  CONVERSATION PROTOCOL:
  - Start your response immediately with "DOCUMENT_TYPE: BANK_STATEMENT"
  - Do NOT include conversational text like "I'll extract..." or "Based on the document..."
  - Do NOT use bullet points, numbered lists, asterisks, or markdown formatting (no **, no ##, no 1., no -)
  - Output ONLY the structured extraction data below
  - End immediately after "TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID:" with no additional text
  - NO explanations, NO comments, NO additional text

  CRITICAL:
  - The transaction table in the image has a "Date", a "Description", a "Withdrawal", a "Deposit" and a "Balance" column

  ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES:
  - YOU MUST NOT GUESS values you are unsure of
  - Rows may have missing values
  - Rows NEVER HAVE REPEATED AMOUNTS, SO YOU MUST NOT REPEAT VALUES THAT YOU ARE UNSURE OF
  - If a value is unclear or missing, use "NOT_FOUND" instead of guessing

  STEP 1:
  - Extract the Transaction Table formatted as markdown.

  STEP 2:
  - Extract the earliest and latest date in the "Date" column from the extracted Transaction Table in STEP 1
  - Format as STATEMENT_DATE_RANGE: [ First date in "Date" column - Last date in "Date" column ]

  STEP 3:
  - Extract the "Date" column from the extracted Transaction Table in STEP 1
  - Format as TRANSACTION_DATES: [ All "Date" column dates, each separated by " | " ] on a single line

  STEP 4:
  - Extract the "Description" column from the extracted Transaction Table in STEP 1
  - Format as LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS: [ All "Description" column descriptions, each separated by " | " ] on a single line

  STEP 5:
  - Extract the "Withdrawal" column from the extracted Transaction Table in STEP 1, replacing missing values with "NOT_FOUND".
  - Format as TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID: [ All "Withdrawal" column amounts each separated by " | " ] on a single line
