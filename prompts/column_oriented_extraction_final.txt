COLUMN-ORIENTED BANK STATEMENT EXTRACTION PROMPT
==================================================

You are an expert at extracting data from Australian bank statements.

TASK: Extract each column separately from the transaction table.

TABLE STRUCTURE:
Column 1: DATE (just the date portion)
Column 2: TRANSACTION (the description text)
Column 3: DEBIT (withdrawal amounts, may be empty)
Column 4: CREDIT (deposit amounts, may be empty)
Column 5: BALANCE (running balance with "CR" notation)

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

For DATE column:
- Extract ONLY the date portion from the leftmost column
- Do NOT include any transaction description text
- Example format: "15 Mar" or "16 Mar" (NOT "15 Mar WOOLWORTHS PAYMENT")

For TRANSACTION column:
- Extract ONLY the description text (everything after the date)
- If the description spans multiple lines, combine them with spaces
- Example: "WOOLWORTHS PAYMENT Card xx1234 Value Date: 20/03/2024"

For DEBIT column:
- Extract amounts from the Debit/Withdrawal column
- If cell is empty, write "EMPTY"
- Example: "$45.00" or "EMPTY"

For CREDIT column:
- Extract amounts from the Credit/Deposit column
- If cell is empty, write "EMPTY"
- NEVER add "CR" suffix to these amounts
- Example: "$120.50" or "EMPTY" (NOT "$120.50 CR")

For BALANCE column:
- Extract amounts from the Balance column
- Keep "CR" notation exactly as shown in the image
- Example: "$1,234.56 CR"

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Extract each column using " | " as separator between entries.
